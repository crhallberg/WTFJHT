1/ **Convicted felon Trump¬†‚Äì again ‚Äì¬†suggested that he‚Äôd prosecute his political opponents if he‚Äôs reelected**. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible, terrible path that they‚Äôre leading us to, and it‚Äôs very possible that it‚Äôs going to have to happen to them,‚Äù Trump said while discussing the 34 felon counts of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records a a New York jury found him guilty of. "Does that mean the next president does it to them? That‚Äôs really the question," he added.

* **üìå [Day 1051](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/12/06/day-1051/#1-trump-refused-to-rule-out-abusing):  Trump refused to rule out abusing power if re-elected president**. In a Fox News town hall, Sean Hannity asked Trump¬†to deny that he would abuse power to seek revenge on political opponents if he returns to the White House. Trump initially dodged the question. "You are promising America tonight you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody?" Hannity asked a second time. "Except for Day One," Trump replied. Asked for clarification, Trump responded: "I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill." Trump then doubled down on his comments: "I love this guy," referring to Hannity. "He says, 'You‚Äôre not going to be a dictator, are you?' I said: 'No, no, no. Other than Day One.' We‚Äôre closing the border, and we‚Äôre drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I‚Äôm not a dictator." Biden‚Äôs campaign, meanwhile, warned Americans that Trump ‚Äúhas been telling us exactly what he will do if he‚Äôs re-elected, and tonight he said he will be a dictator on Day 1. Americans should believe him."

* **üìå [Day 1028](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/11/13/day-1028/#trump-%E2%80%93%20echoing-fascist-dictators-li): Trump ‚Äì¬†echoing fascist dictators like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini ‚Äì¬†"pledged" to "root out" his political opponents, which he called "vermin" and claimed they ‚Äúlie, steal and cheat on elections.‚Äù**  In a Veterans Day post, Trump suggested that his political opponents pose a greater "threat from within" to the U.S. than "outside forces" like Russia, China, or North Korea. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/12/trump-rally-vermin-political-opponents/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/11/us/politics/trump-new-hampshire-veterans.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-compares-political-opponents-vermin-root-alarming-historians/story?id=104847748))

2/ **A Georgia appeals court indefinitely postponed convicted felon Trump‚Äôs election subversion case** while a lower court resolves an appeal by Trump and his eight other defendants seeking to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. [In March](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/08/day-1205/#1-a-georgia-court-agreed-to-hear-tru), Judge Scott McAfee declined to remove Willis following revelations that she was engaged in a romantic relationship with a member of her legal team. The appeals court is expected to rule on the disqualification issue by March 2025.

3/ **The federal judge overseeing convicted felon Trump‚Äôs trial involving "willful retention" of classified documents in violation of the Espionage Act ‚Äì again ‚Äì abruptly changed the court‚Äôs schedule**. Judge Aileen Cannon granted Trump‚Äôs request to allow third parties not involved in the case to argue whether the appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel is legal. The parties include conservative lawyers Josh Blackman and Gene Schaerr ‚Äì constitutional scholars with connections to the right-wing Federalist Society ‚Äì and Matthew Seligman, a legal scholar who thinks that Trump‚Äôs motion is ‚Äúmeritless.‚Äù Cannon also agreed to hear Trump‚Äôs arguments that the FBI plotted to assassinate him while executing a court-authorized search warrant at Mar-a-Lago ‚Äì¬†a made-up conspiracy theory that Smith said were "intentionally false and inflammatory‚Äù and Attorney General Merrick Garland called "baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods." Nevertheless, Cannon [denied](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/28/day-1225/#1-the-judge-presiding-over-trump%E2%80%99s-c) Smith‚Äôs gag order request last week, because she deemed it ‚Äúwholly lacking in substance and professional courtesy.‚Äù In May, Cannon ‚Äì a Trump-appointee ‚Äì¬†[indefinitely postponed](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/07/day-1204/#6-the-judge-in-trump%E2%80%99s-classified-do) the trial to rule on "myriad and interconnected pre-trial" without setting a new date.

4/ **Convicted felon Trump asked the judge overseeing his election interference trial involving falsified business records to terminate the gag order because the trial is over**. Trump argued that his need for "unrestrained campaign advocacy" is greater because Biden called Trump‚Äôs behavior "reckless, dangerous, and irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict." Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, however, opposed Trump‚Äôs request, arguing that Trump's partial gag order should stay in effect through sentencing on July 11 to protect the integrity of the proceedings. Trump was fined $10,000 during the trial for violating the gag order, which barred him from making comments about witnesses, jurors, prosecutors, and court staff.

5/ **Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic measure to protect the federal right to access contraception nationwide**. The vote on the Right to Contraception Act was 51-39, falling short of the 60 votes needed to defeat a Republican filibuster. Two Republicans ‚Äì Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski ‚Äî voted with Democrats. The Senate is expected to take up legislation to protect access to in vitro fertilization next week.
