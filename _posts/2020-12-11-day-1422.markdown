1/ **The White House ordered the FDA commissioner to grant emergency use authorization for Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine by the end of the day or resign**. An FDA panel of outside advisers recommended that the agency grant emergency use authorization yesterday, and signoff was expected this weekend. Following White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows's call with Stephen Hahn, the FDA accelerated its timetable for approving America‚Äôs first vaccine from Saturday morning to later Friday, saying "it will rapidly work toward finalization and issuance of an emergency use authorization." Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, meanwhile, said the Trump administration informed Pfizer that they "intend to proceed towards an authorization for their vaccine."

4/ **The attorneys general for Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia asked the Supreme Court to reject Republican efforts to overturn Biden's victory**. Pennsylvania called the last-ditch legal effort by Texas and Trump ‚Äúseditious‚Äù and built on an ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù foundation, warning that ‚ÄúTexas invites this court to overthrow the votes of the American people and choose the next president of the United States. That Faustian invitation must be firmly rejected.‚Äù The New York Times reports that the lawsuit, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and backed by 17 other states and 106 Republican members of Congress, "represents the most coordinated, politicized attempt to overturn the will of the voters in recent American history." Trump ‚Äì repeating his baseless claims of widespread fraud ‚Äì¬†demanded that the court ‚Äúsave our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/us/trump-election-lawsuit-states.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/with-time-running-out-trump-and-gop-allies-turn-up-pressure-on-supreme-court-in-election-assault/2020/12/10/4268511a-3b03-11eb-bc68-96af0daae728_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/10/seditious-abuse-judicial-process-reject-texas-effort-election-joe-biden-win-444414) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-lawsuit-supreme-court-106-house-republicans/) / [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/skbaer/list-republican-house-members-overturn-election) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/house-republicans-texas-lawsuit-election-a33e2081-89fa-442a-b1f6-eb1fcf9f4b16.html))

5/ **The FBI issued at least one federal subpoena for records from the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton amid  whistleblower allegations**.

Paxton, who is leading the last-ditch effort to overturn election results in four battleground states lost by Trump, also faces a 5-year-old indictment on felony securities fraud charges. Paxton, however, said he has not discussed a presidential pardon with the White House, calling the suggestion "ridiculous."
