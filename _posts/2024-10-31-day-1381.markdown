* **üí° How not to freak out about the election**. ‚ÄúDo you have a problem now?‚Äù ‚ÄúNarrow your life down to this moment. Your life situation may be full of problems ‚Äì most life situations are ‚Äì but find out if you have any problem at this moment. Not tomorrow or in ten minutes, but now.‚Äù([Oliver Burkeman](https://ckarchive.com/b/38uphkho8gnelb37xxl75f4n98pnns7))

* **‚è≥ When polls close in each state and how long it may take to count votes**. "Vote counting isn‚Äôt expected to be nearly as slow as it was last time around, but there‚Äôs a chance we won‚Äôt know the outcome of the presidential race ‚Äî and possibly even control of Congress ‚Äî on election night." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/29/poll-close-times/))

1/ **Trump vowed to "protect" women ‚Äúwhether the women like it or not‚Äù** after he said his "people" told him it was "inappropriate." He added: "I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not; I'm going to protect them." The comments follow Trump remarks in recent months that he would ‚Äúprotect women‚Äù and make sure they wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúthinking about abortion‚Äù despite appointing the three justices to the Supreme Court who formed the conservative majority that overturned the federal right to abortion. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, called Trump‚Äôs comments "offensive to everybody" and that they‚Äôre proof Trump ‚Äúis not going to be fighting for women's reproductive rights.‚Äù Women have outpaced men in early voting in states where results are reported by gender. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/31/trump-women-protector-harris/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/31/us/harris-trump-election) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-protect-women-like-it-or-not-rcna178147) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/31/trump-harris-women-whether-they-like-it-or-not) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-f5903d49488ebc733d7ba5812b36f935) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/31/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/harris-trump-protect-women-whether-they-like-it-or-not-00186506))

* **They Want to Ensure That, This Time, White Women Vote for a Woman**. "Donald Trump has won white women, the country‚Äôs largest voting bloc, for two elections running. White female Democrats are trying to stop that from happening again, but it may be an uphill fight." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/us/politics/white-women-harris-trump-2024-election.html))

* **MAGA Bros Are Freaking Out Because So Many Women Are Voting**. "‚ÄúUnless this changes, Kamala Harris takes PA and it‚Äôs over,‚Äù tweeted right wing gadfly Mike Cernovich." ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/maga-bros-are-freaking-out-because-so-many-women-are-voting/))

* ‚ÄòLike it or not‚Äô: In one quote, Trump distills the 2024 gender gap. "The former president‚Äôs comment at a Wisconsin rally was a pithy encapsulation of the concerns that are spurring a lot of women‚Äôs votes." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/31/trump-distills-gender-gap/))

2/ **The Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred measure of inflation fell to its lowest level since February 2021**. Prices rose 2.1% in September compared to a year ago. The central bank‚Äôs goal is 2%.

* **The Next President Inherits a Remarkable Economy**. "The high quality of recent economic growth should put a wind at the back of the White House‚Äôs next occupant." ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/the-next-president-inherits-a-remarkable-economy-7be2d059))

3/ **North Korea launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile intended to send a message to "rivals"** who have "escalated" regional tensions. Shortly after the U.S. and South Korea condemned the country for deploying troops near Ukraine to join Russia‚Äôs war effort, Kim Jong Un ordered the missile test, calling the launch "an appropriate military action" to show that North Korea would respond to enemies that "posed a threat to the security of our republic recently." It was the first major weapons test since September. About 8,000 North Korean soldiers are [now in Russia](https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-north-korea-troops-russia-ukraine-9ee96dc1d4f07ac0813c698e6873f96b) near Ukraine‚Äôs border. Russia has reportedly been training North Korean soldiers in artillery, drones, and ‚Äúbasic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they fully intend to use these forces in front line operations.‚Äù ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-launch-377c07eac46ad41bda0d4445df6f51d5) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/30/north-korea-ballistic-missile-launch-icbm/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/asia/north-korea-missile-launch.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/north-korea-icbm-launch-intended-message-rivals-kim/story?id=115342345) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/31/trump-harris-respond-russia-north-korea))

* **U.S. Turns to China to Stop North Korean Troops From Fighting for Russia**. "American agencies have assessed that China dislikes the growing partnership between Russia and North Korea. The State Department has raised the troop issue with Chinese diplomats." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/us/politics/russia-north-korea-troops-china.html))
