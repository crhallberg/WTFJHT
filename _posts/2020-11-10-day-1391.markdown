1/ **Attorney General William Barr authorized federal prosecutors to investigate ‚Äúsubstantial allegations‚Äù of voter fraud ‚Äì if they exist ‚Äì before the results of the election are certified, despite no evidence of widespread fraud**. In a reversal of long-standing Justice Department policy, Barr wrote that investigations ‚Äúmay be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State.‚Äù In Barr‚Äôs directive, he said he had already approved probes related to the 2020 election ‚Äúin specific instances,‚Äù but did not elaborate on the circumstances or whether they remained open.

* **Trump‚Äôs campaign filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania to block state officials from certifying President-elect Biden‚Äôs victory in the state**.

2/ **The Justice Department's top election crimes prosecutor resigned in protest after Barr authorized U.S. attorneys to probe alleged elections fraud**.

3/ **Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ignored Biden‚Äôs victory and claimed there will be a ‚Äúsmooth transition‚Äù to a second Trump term**. ‚ÄúWe must count every legal vote,‚Äù Pompeo said. "We must make sure that any vote that was not lawful ought not be counted, that dilutes your vote if it‚Äôs done improperly, gotta get that right. When we get it right, we‚Äôll get it right.‚Äù When asked whether the State Department was prepared to engage with Biden‚Äôs transition team, Pompeo replied: "There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration."

4/ **The White House budget office instructed federal agencies to proceed with plans for Trump's February budget**.
