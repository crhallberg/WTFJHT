1/ **A federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship**, calling it "blatantly unconstitutional" and issuing a 14-day nationwide restraining order while the legal challenge proceeds. U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, criticized the order as legally indefensible, saying: “I have been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear.” He added, “It just boggles my mind” that the administration’s lawyers would argue its constitutionality. Four Democratic-led states, led by Washington, filed the lawsuit, arguing the order violates the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to all children born on U.S. soil. The group argued that Trump’s order would create a “Presidentially-created underclass” by denying rights and benefits for more than 150,000 children born annually, leaving them “undocumented, subject to removal or detention, and many stateless.” The case – one of five lawsuits being brought by 22 states – is expected to land in the Supreme Court.

2/ **The Trump administration ordered federal workers to report colleagues involved in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility roles or face "adverse consequences."** Emails sent to federal employees gave them 10 days to report DEIA-related activities, citing concerns that such programs were being disguised under different terms. The administration also directed agencies to place DEIA staff on paid leave and finalize plans to eliminate those roles by January 31. Trump described DEIA programs as wasteful and divisive, part of broader efforts to dismantle diversity initiatives across federal agencies. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/federal-workers-told-name-dei-colleagues-risk-adverse-consequences-rcna188871) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-order-discrimination-federal-hiring.html))
 
3/ **Trump revoked a landmark 1965 anti-discrimination measure enacted by Lyndon B. Johnson to promote affirmative action and prohibit discrimination among federal contractors**. The order required contractors to take proactive steps to eliminate bias based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin. Trump criticized the rule as part of “radical DEI preferencing” and claimed it undermined merit-based hiring. Advocacy groups and Democrats condemned the move, arguing it dismantled protections for marginalized workers and reversed decades of progress in combating workplace discrimination. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/23/trump-revoked-equal-employment-opportunity-order/) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-executive-order-discrimination-lbj_n_67914b7ce4b0835f2b834b9c))

4/ **Trump signed an executive order to declassify all remaining government records related to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr**. Trump said the release was long overdue and promised transparency, saying, "Everything will be revealed." Previous administrations, including his own, delayed the full release of JFK records, despite a 1992 law requiring their disclosure. The National Archives has already made 97% of JFK-related records public, but some files remained classified, fueling conspiracy theories. After signing the order, Trump remarked: “That’s a big one, huh?” ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-announces-jfk-rfk-mlk-assassination-files-to-be-released/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/trump-declassifies-kennedy-king-jfk-assassination-files.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/23/trump-classified-files-jfk-mlk-assassinations-executive-order) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/23/us/trump-news/068caeb3-1649-531a-bb22-b52a8941c361?smid=url-share) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/23/trump-presidency-news/#link-E24NNMDKEFCW3I3MFHJRF4N5JE) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/trump-2nd-term-live-updates-executive-action-plans?id=117934786&entryId=118040566) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-davos-hannity-interview-jan-6-pardons-live-updates-rcna188606))

5/ **Trump signed an executive order to evaluate the creation of a "national digital asset stockpile,"** promoting cryptocurrency innovation and development in the U.S. While crypto advocates hoped for an outright bitcoin reserve, the order instead focuses on assessing the feasibility of such a reserve and creating a working group for further study. Trump, a past crypto critic, reversed his stance during his 2024 campaign, courting crypto industry support, which eventually became his largest donor group. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/trump-signs-executive-order-on-crypto-digital-asset-stockpile.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-23/trump-s-signs-executive-actions-related-to-cryptocurrency-ai) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/trump-bitcoin-digital-asset-stockpile-strategic-reserve-cryptocurrency-rcna188921))

6/ **Trump called for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates “immediately.”** Trump, however, has no direct authority over the Fed, which operates independently. The Fed recently lowered rates to counter inflation but is expected to hold them steady at its upcoming meeting. Trump blamed high rates and inflation on “wasteful deficit spending” under Biden, describing it as the “worst inflation crisis in modern history.” ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/president-donald-trump-says-hell-demand-that-interest-rates-drop-immediately.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/23/trump-davos-world-economic-forum) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-davos-hannity-interview-jan-6-pardons-live-updates-rcna188606) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/23/trump-presidency-news/#link-GTKJ6QUXJVGZREQYUQ7H6SZLWQ) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-23/trump-urges-opec-to-lower-oil-prices-warns-of-tariffs-at-davos))

7/ **The Senate confirmed John Ratcliffe as CIA director** in a bipartisan 74-25 vote, making him the second Trump nominee approved in his second term. Ratcliffe pledged to remove political biases from the agency and focus on countering threats like China. He promised to protect civil liberties, "speak truth to power," and lead an aggressive intelligence strategy. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-confirms-john-ratcliffe-trumps-cia-director-rcna188588) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-23/trump-cia-director-pick-john-ratcliffe-confirmed-by-us-senate) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/23/g-s1-44389/john-ratcliffe-cia-director) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/john-ratcliffe-cia-director-trump.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/23/john-ratcliffe-cia-senate-cofirms))

8/ **The Senate voted 51-49 to advance Pete Hegseth’s nomination as Secretary of Defense**, despite allegations of sexual assault, financial misconduct, and excessive drinking. Two Republicans – Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins – joined Democrats in opposing the procedural vote, citing concerns about Hegseth's judgment, past behavior, and views on women in combat roles. A final confirmation vote is expected Friday, with Hegseth needing near-unanimous Republican support to secure the position. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/hegseth-defense-secretary.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pete-hegseths-nomination-lead-pentagon-clears-key-hurdle-senate-rcna188932) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-pentagon-trump-confirmation-79d38a3d821eda7e03789e857b417a7f) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/23/trump-presidency-news/#link-GSEN7HUTCNH5LIG5ZCOUHPVX5I) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/pete-hegseth-confirmation-vote-goes-down-to-the-wire-e91fd01f))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Trump revoked security protection for Mike Pompeo, Brian Hook, and John Bolton despite warnings from intelligence agencies about continued threats from Iran**. The Biden administration had previously maintained their protection due to assessed threats tied to the 2020 drone strike on Iranian General Qassim Suleimani. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/trump-pompeo-security-iran.html))

2. **Trump granted temporary security clearances to unvetted officials**, citing a clearance backlog. The backlog resulted in part from Trump's delay in initiating the formal transition process after the election. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-temporary-security-clearances/index.html))

3. **Trump nominated David Fotouhi – a lawyer with a record of defending polluting industries and rolling back environmental protections – as EPA deputy administrator**. Fotouhi, who helped roll back climate and water protections during Trump’s first term, recently challenged the EPA’s asbestos ban and represented companies involved in lawsuits over PFAS contamination and toxic chemicals. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/david-fotouhi-donald-trump-epa-pollution))

4. **Trump threatened to withhold federal disaster aid for the Los Angeles wildfires** unless California changes its water management policies, repeating a false claim that conservation efforts are responsible for fire hydrant shortages in Los Angeles. Trump also suggested that "states take care of their own problems" with federal financial support as needed, saying "The FEMA is getting in the way of everything." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/22/trump-hannity-interview/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-republicans-taxes-eea4754a0f580d451aa0588f0639d52c) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/23/trump-fema-states-sean-hannity-interview))

5. **Trump suggested Congress investigate Biden and those he pardoned**, saying “Those people that he pardoned are now mandated, because they got a pardon, to testify, and they can’t take the 5th.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/22/trump-hannity-takeaways-fox-interview-00200167))

6. **An aide to House Speaker Mike Johnson advised against subpoenaing Cassidy Hutchinson in the investigation of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack**, citing concerns that sexually explicit texts sent by lawmakers to Hutchinson might be exposed. The aide warned that a subpoena could also allow Hutchinson to retell her testimony, potentially embarrassing the Trump White House. Rep. Barry Loudermilk, who led a prior Republican investigation into Jan. 6, had considered subpoenaing Hutchinson to obtain new information but did not proceed. Johnson has since reconstituted the investigation under a new House subcommittee led by Loudermilk.
