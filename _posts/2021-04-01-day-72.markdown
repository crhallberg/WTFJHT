1/ **The Texas Senate passed new voting restrictions in the state**. Senate Bill 7 would limit extended early voting hours, prohibit drive-thru voting, and make it illegal for election officials to send applications to vote by mail to voters, even if they qualify. The bill now heads to the House for consideration. ([Texas Tribune](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/01/texas-voting-restrictions-legislature/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/texas-senate-passes-restrictive-new-voting-bill-n1262743) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/legislature-bills-voting-rights-elections-greg-abbott-18c254a6597e7a13ea45205cb35b3dd2))

2/ **Georgia's Republican-controlled House stripped Delta Air Lines of a tax break worth tens of millions of dollars as punishment for its CEO's criticism of the state's new voting restrictions**. The bill, however, was not taken up by the state Senate before it adjourned and has not become law. Deltaâ€™s CEO, Ed Bastian, called the bill "unacceptable" and that it "does not match Deltaâ€™s values." Bastian added: "The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true." Delta Air Lines is Georgiaâ€™s largest employer. Coca-Cola, UPS, Home Depot, Porsche Cars North America, and the Atlanta Falcons have also criticized the legislation.

3/ **About 15 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine were accidentally ruined** after a manufacturing contractor mistakenly mixed the vaccine with ingredients from the AstraZeneca coronavirus shot. The company still met its goal of shipping 20 million doses to the U.S. in March, and has promised 100 million doses by the end of May.

4/ **Biden asked Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to conduct a review of his legal authority to cancel student debt**. White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Biden will make a decision on how to proceed once he reviews the memo. "Heâ€™ll look at that legal authority, heâ€™ll look at the policy issues around that, and then heâ€™ll make a decision," Klain said. "He hasnâ€™t made a decision on that, either way, in fact, he hasnâ€™t yet gotten the memos that he needs to start to focus on that decision."
