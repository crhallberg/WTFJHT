1/ **Biden, in his farewell address, warned of the rise of an oligarchy and a “tech-industrial complex” that he said threatens democracy**, basic freedoms, and economic fairness in the United States. Biden, speaking from the Oval Office, stated, “Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy.” He invoked Eisenhower’s warning of a “military-industrial complex” and drew parallels to the risks posed by technology giants, saying, “Six decades later, I’m equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex.” Biden criticized social media platforms for abandoning fact-checking, lamenting that “The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit.” Reflecting on his legacy, he said, “It will take time to feel the full impact of all we’ve done together. But the seeds are planted.” As he prepares to leave office, Biden urged Americans to “be the keeper of the flame” and “stand guard” to protect democracy.

* **Biden’s claim that he “could have beaten Trump” in the 2024 election has reportedly left Harris disappointed and saddened**, straining their relationship during their final days in office. According to close allies, Harris viewed Biden’s remarks as a reflection of the “one-sided loyalty” in their partnership, which had grown over the years but faced challenges as Harris took the lead on the Democratic ticket. While Biden insisted he stepped aside to unify the party, saying, “I didn’t want to be one who caused a party that wasn’t unified to lose an election,” Harris expressed private frustration over the perception his comments created. The tension was visible during public appearances, including at Jimmy Carter’s funeral, where the two barely interacted despite being seated together. Harris reportedly feels Biden’s statements undermined her campaign and added to the difficulties of her transition out of public office.

2/ **Big Tech executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, are playing prominent roles in Trump’s inauguration**. Zuckerberg and other tech leaders are co-hosting high-profile events during Trump’s second inauguration, aligning themselves with an administration that could shape policies favorable to their industries. Chew has also been invited as an honored guest, despite the platform facing a U.S. ban set to take effect the day before. Other wealthy tech executives like Peter Thiel and Musk are also throwing exclusive parties, while corporations and donors have contributed millions to Trump’s inaugural committee in exchange for VIP access. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/trump-tech-inauguration-parties.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/16/tiktok-trump-inauguration/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/16/tiktok-ceo-trump-inauguration-ban) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump-inauguration.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tiktok-ceo-shou-chew-expected-attend-trumps-inauguration-rcna187948))

3/ **Trump is considering an executive order to delay the impending U.S. ban on TikTok**, which is set to take effect Sunday unless ByteDance, its Chinese owner, divests from the company. This move comes as both Trump and the outgoing Biden administration face legal and political challenges related to the app, including its national security risks and bipartisan support for the ban. Trump, who had previously backed banning TikTok, has shifted his position, citing its influence among voters. Legal and logistical hurdles remain significant, with the app’s future hinging on divestiture, legal action, or potential intervention by the new administration. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-administration-keep-tiktok-available-us-rcna187902) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/16/politics/biden-administration-tiktok-ban/index.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/tiktok-ceo-planning-to-attend-trumps-inauguration-a7b9a959) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/trump-tiktok-executive-order.html) / [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-will-reportedly-shut-down-its-app-completely-on-sunday-2000550589))

4/ **House Democrats urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to release the second volume of special counsel Jack Smith’s report on Trump’s handling of classified documents, even if it requires dropping charges against two of Trump’s co-defendants**. In a letter led by Rep. Jamie Raskin, Democrats argued that the public has a “right to know” how Trump allegedly retained classified materials and obstructed the investigation. They stated that dropping charges against Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira may be necessary, as Trump is expected to end those prosecutions once in office. Garland had previously refused to release the report while legal proceedings for Nauta and De Oliveira were ongoing. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and Smith resigned after filing his report, which concluded that Trump committed “unprecedented” acts to retain classified materials and subvert the 2020 election.

5/ **House Speaker Mike Johnson removed Rep. Mike Turner as chair of the House Intelligence Committee**, citing the need for a “fresh start” under a new Congress and Trump. Turner, an advocate for Ukraine aid and hawkish national security policies, clashed with Trump-aligned House conservatives, who had pressed for his removal. Turner’s support for renewing surveillance powers and his bipartisan approach to committee oversight further alienated hard-liners. Johnson downplayed Trump’s role in the decision, but acknowledged “concerns from Mar-a-Lago.” Turner’s removal drew bipartisan criticism, with top Democrat Rep. Jim Himes stating it “makes our nation less secure.” Johnson plans to name Rep. Rick Crawford as Turner’s replacement. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/house-intelligence-committee-speaker-0a28ddc03b3944b4d459f7ff5f0278bd) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/15/johnson-removes-mike-turner-as-intel-chair-00198522) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/16/mike-johnson-rick-crawford-house-intel-committee))

6/ **Recap of today’s Trump’s Cabinet confirmation hearings: Doug Burgum, Lee Zeldin, and Scott Bessent testified in Senate hearings**, defending their nominations to lead the Interior Department, EPA, and Treasury, respectively, while emphasizing Trump’s agenda on energy, environmental deregulation, and tax cuts. Burgum supported Trump’s “energy dominance” strategy, saying “When energy production is restricted in America it doesn’t reduce demand. It just shifts productions to countries like Russia and Iran, whose autocratic leaders not don’t care at all about the environment, but they use their revenues from energy sales to fund wars against us and our allies.” Although Lee Zeldin said “I believe that climate change is real,” he avoided committing the EPA to regulating greenhouse gases, signaling alignment with Trump’s rollback of environmental protections. Scott Bessent defended making the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent, saying “Failing to extend the tax cuts would represent the largest tax increase in history.” He also advocated for expanded tariffs and addressed questions about Bitcoin and federal debt. All three nominees highlighted the administration’s priorities of economic growth, deregulation, and reduced environmental oversight, setting the stage for legislative battles in the coming months.

* **Trump’s Energy pick Chris Wright called climate change a “real issue” in Senate hearings**, but critics highlight his ties to fossil fuels and past climate denial. His confirmation could reshape U.S. energy and climate policy. ([Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/chris-wright-energy-secretary-climate-change/))

* **Trump’s advisers are developing oil sanctions strategies aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war while simultaneously increasing pressure on Iran and Venezuela**. The incoming Trump administration is weighing two options regarding Russian oil sanctions: intensifying measures to pressure Russia or offering relief as part of a peace deal with Ukraine. Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent supports stronger sanctions, calling existing efforts insufficient. Trump is also preparing to reinstate a “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran and Venezuela, targeting their oil industries. Analysts warn these moves could disrupt global oil markets, drive up prices, and strain diplomatic relations with countries dependent on Russian, Iranian, or Venezuelan oil. Trump has signaled upcoming talks with Putin as part of the Ukraine peace effort, but his team faces challenges balancing sanctions enforcement with avoiding economic instability. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/trump-team-readies-oil-sanctions-plan-for-russia-deal-iran-squeeze))

* **Florida Governor Ron DeSantis appointed state Attorney General Ashley Moody to replace Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate** following Rubio’s nomination as Secretary of State by Trump. DeSantis praised Moody as a strong supporter of Trump’s “America First” agenda and his own conservative priorities, such as fighting illegal immigration, limiting federal bureaucracy, and opposing “woke ideology.” Moody will hold the Senate seat until a special election in 2026.

7/ **The House passed a bipartisan bill mandating the deportation of immigrants with uncertain legal status who are convicted of committing sex crimes**, domestic violence, or similar offenses, despite existing laws already permitting such deportations. The bill passed with significant Democratic support, as Republicans prioritized strict immigration measures during their governing trifecta with Trump. The bill adopts broader definitions of domestic violence and includes mandatory deportations for immigrants convicted of stalking, child abuse, or violating protection orders. This is part of a series of immigration bills emphasizing harsher enforcement, such as the Laken Riley Act, which mandates detention for immigrants accused of theft. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/house-bill-deport-immigrants.html) / [Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy/395167/laken-riley-act-congress-immigration-detention-senate-trump))

8/ **Rudy Giuliani reached a settlement with two Georgia election workers he defamed**, allowing him to keep his New York apartment and a Florida condo, in exchange for an undisclosed payment and his agreement to cease defamatory statements. Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss had previously won a $146 million judgment against Giuliani for false claims of election fraud, but settlement negotiations resolved the debt collection dispute. Freeman and Moss described the last four years as a “living nightmare” and welcomed the resolution. Giuliani denied liability in the settlement and reiterated his satisfaction with the outcome. The settlement doesn’t resolve contempt rulings against Giuliani in related cases, which could still result in penalties.

9/ **The White House issued long-overdue guidance on open government data** – six years after Congress mandated its release – requiring agencies to make public records accessible by default, protect privacy, and create data inventories to promote transparency. The guidance fulfills a key mandate of the bipartisan 2018 law but comes without presidential leadership or oversight, which hindered progress since its passage. Advocates praised the milestone for embedding openness in government practices but emphasized the need for accountability to restore public trust.

### 🔍 Dept. of Context and Consequence.

1. **The U.S. failed to enforce its warnings to Israel, enabling human rights abuses in Gaza while continuing military support**. Biden’s administration repeatedly issued warnings to Israel over its actions in Gaza, but failed to enforce any meaningful consequences, resulting in continued human rights violations and significant international criticism. Despite the administration’s red lines, including withholding military aid if humanitarian conditions did not improve, the U.S. provided billions in arms while Israel restricted aid, displaced civilians, and was accused of actions labeled as war crimes and genocide by international bodies. The lack of enforcement of U.S. policies eroded American credibility, with some experts calling Biden’s warnings a “smokescreen” and noting that such inaction emboldened Israel. Diplomats and officials criticized the State Department’s dismissal of internal dissent and human rights advocacy, while organizations like the ICC and Amnesty International highlighted atrocities in Gaza. As protests and anti-American sentiment grew in the Muslim world, Biden’s approach to Israel became a defining and controversial aspect of his foreign policy. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/biden-blinken-state-department-israel-gaza-human-rights-horrors))

2. **Trump shaped the Gaza cease-fire by offering incentives and aligning with Israeli interests, but the agreement reflects broader diplomatic efforts and the realities on the ground rather than a singular achievement**. Israel and Hamas agreed to a phased cease-fire deal after 15 months of conflict, exchanging Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and setting conditions for Gaza’s reconstruction. The deal, influenced by Trump’s presidency and Biden’s earlier proposal, reflects Hamas’s weakened position and Israel’s strategic concessions under Netanyahu’s hard-right government. Trump’s promises of favorable policies toward Israel and pressure from his administration played a key role in securing the agreement. The cease-fire remains fragile, with ongoing risks of renewed hostilities and unresolved tensions between all parties. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/01/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire-biden-trump/681325/))

3. **The GOP has shifted away from prioritizing national security in favor of political loyalty and culture wars**. Pete Hegseth’s Senate confirmation hearing for secretary of defense showcased concerns about his qualifications, character, and the GOP's prioritization of party loyalty over national security. Despite critical questions on nuclear weapons, Geneva Conventions, and military standards, Hegseth’s vague answers underscored his focus on cultural issues and allegiance to Trump. Democrats criticized his lack of experience and past accusations, while Republican senators avoided substantive policy discussions, opting instead for partisan rhetoric. Allies and adversaries likely viewed the hearing as a weakening of U.S. defense credibility, raising questions about leadership at the Pentagon. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/01/the-hegseth-hearing-was-a-national-embarrassment/681315/))

4. **Trump’s "light speed" deportation plan faces logistical, legal, and ethical hurdles, raising questions about feasibility and impact**. Trump plans to implement a large-scale deportation campaign immediately after taking office, targeting undocumented immigrants and those with criminal records, according to top aides. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has identified approximately 11 million individuals as deportable, including over 650,000 with criminal histories and 1.4 million with prior deportation orders. Logistical and legal challenges, such as limited detention capacity, workforce shortages, and resistance from certain countries, may constrain the scope of such efforts. The Biden administration’s use of temporary protective measures and parole programs has created additional groups that Trump could target, but his strategy may face significant political, legal, and operational barriers. Critics and experts express concerns over the economic and humanitarian consequences of mass deportations. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/interactive/2025/trump-immigrants-mass-deportations/))

5. **The U.S. military is debating the ethical and legal implications of potential domestic deployments under Trump’s leadership**. Trump’s plan to potentially deploy U.S. military forces on domestic soil has sparked debates among military officials, lawyers, and ethicists about legality, ethics, and potential consequences. Concerns include whether troops would be used for political purposes, the lack of training for domestic operations, and the possibility of excessive force. Legal experts highlight the broad authority the Insurrection Act grants the president, while some fear misuse of this power could harm constitutional rights. Retired officials stress the importance of clear rules of engagement to avoid incidents like past misinterpretations during domestic deployments. The debate reflects broader questions about the military's role in civilian law enforcement and its limits under the Constitution.
