1/ **The U.S. Census Bureau released the first set of updated state population totals from the 2020 census**, which were delayed for months due to the coronavirus pandemic and the Trump administration's [interference](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/09/25/day-1345/#6-a-federal-judge-ordered-the-2020-c) last year. California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia all lost a seat in the House, while Texas picked up two seats, and Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina, and Oregon all gained one seat each. Over the past decade, the U.S. population grew at the slowest rate since the 1930s. The full Census data used for redistricting will not be publicly released until the end of September.

2/ **The Justice Department opened an investigation into the practices of the Louisville Metro Police Department** – 13 months after LMPD officers killed Breonna Taylor inside her own apartment while serving a no-knock warrant. Attorney General Merrick Garland referred to Taylor during his announcement of the investigation, saying the Justice Department "will assess whether (Louisville Metro Police Department) engages in a pattern or practice of using unreasonable force, including with respect to people involved in peaceful expressive activities." Last week, Garland announced a [similar investigation](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/04/21/day-92/#1-the-justice-department-will-invest) into the Minneapolis Police Department following the police killing of George Floyd.

3/ **Biden signed an executive order to create a White House task force to promote union membership**. Kamala Harris will lead the task force, which will issue recommendations about how the federal government can use its authority to help workers join labor unions and bargain collectively. In 2018, Trump [signed](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/08/27/day-585/#4-a-federal-judge-struck-down-most-o) three executive orders to limit union protections and bargaining rights for federal employees.

4/ **The Department of Agriculture extended a pandemic benefits program to feed up to 34 million children from low-income families over this summer**. The plan will provide about $375 per child to buy food for the roughly 10 weeks they are out of school in the summer – about $7 a weekday.

5/ **The U.S. will send 60 million doses of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine abroad**. The AstraZeneca vaccine, which hasn't been authorized for use in the U.S. by the FDA, will be sent to other countries once it clears federal safety reviews. “We do not need to use AstraZeneca in our fight against covid,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. AstraZeneca has not sought FDA authorization for its vaccine, but has already manufactured millions of doses in the U.S. under a federal contract.

6/ **The CEO of a vaccine production facility sold more than $10 million worth of his company stock before disclosing that it had ruined 15 million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine**. The transactions were Robert Kramer's first substantive sales of Emergent stock since April 2016.

7/ **The Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal to a New York law that restricts an individual from carrying a concealed handgun in public**.
