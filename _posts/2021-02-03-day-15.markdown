1/ **Biden urged congressional Democrats to press ahead with the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan**, saying "I'm not going to start my administration by breaking a promise to the American people." Biden said he was open to negotiating the price tag for his Covid-19 relief proposal, including narrowing the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to focus on poor and middle-class people, but that he wouldn‚Äôt reduce the amount of the stimulus checks. "I think we can better target the number," Biden said, but ‚ÄúWe need to act ‚Äî we need to act fast.‚Äù ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/03/963622911/biden-forges-ahead-on-relief-bill-without-gop-but-signals-checks-could-be-target) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/we-need-act-fast-biden-democrats-move-speed-process-pass-n1256636) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/03/politics/biden-hill-democrats-stick-together/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/biden-to-meet-with-democratic-senators-on-his-stimulus-plan?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/03/biden-dems-call-stimulus-checks-465484) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-signals-openness-to-sending-1-400-stimulus-checks-to-smaller-group-11612380292))

Trump for his role in inciting the violent attack at the Capitol, but our senators do,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúAnd for our sake, and the sake of the country, we ask that they vote to convict the former president and bar him from ever holding office again.‚Äù The staff members described ducking under office desks, barricading themselves in offices, and watching as rioters ‚Äúsmashed‚Äù their way through the Capitol on Jan. 6, blaming  Trump and his ‚Äúbaseless, months long effort to reject votes lawfully cast by the American people.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/us/politics/congress-trump-impeachment.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/03/politics/congressional-staffers-impeachment-letter/index.html))

5/ **The House adopted rules to fine lawmakers up to $10,000 for bypassing security measures that were enacted after the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob**. The measure passed on a 216-to-210 vote, with all but three Democrats present voting in favor and all Republicans present voting ‚Äúno.‚Äù In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: ‚ÄúIt is beyond comprehension why any member would refuse to adhere to these simple, commonsense steps to keep this body safe."([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/02/house-vote-tonight-leveling-fines-up-10000-lawmakers-who-flout-security-screening/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-backs-fines-10-000-members-who-evade-metal-detectors-n1256571))
