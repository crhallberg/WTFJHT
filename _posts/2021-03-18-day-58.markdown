1/ **The U.S. is on track to surpass Biden's goal of administering 100 million Covid-19 shots by Friday**. Just over 99 million shots have been administered since Biden took office, and the country is averaging nearly 2.5 million injections per day. 65% of people age 65 or older had received at least one shot and 36% have been fully vaccinated. The Biden administration is reportedly looking toward the middle of May to relax travel restrictions with Mexico and Canada, and on inbound international travel from the U.K., Europe, and Brazil.

2/ **Biden agreed to send about 2.5 million of doses of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine to Mexico**. The announcement of the vaccine deal follows a recent call where Biden asked President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador of Mexico whether more could be done to limit the flow of migrants coming to the border. Today, Mexico announced that it will limit travel across its northern and southern borders starting March 19, and deploy sanitary control measures at both borders to slow the spread of Covid-19. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the discussions over vaccines and border security were ‚Äúunrelated‚Äù but also ‚Äúoverlapping.‚Äù When asked if the vaccine offer to Mexico had ‚Äústrings attached,‚Äù Psaki replied that there were ‚Äúseveral diplomatic conversations ‚Äî parallel conversations ‚Äî many layers of conversations‚Äù at play. The U.S. will also send about 1.5 million doses to Canada.

3/ **An inspector general‚Äôs report found no evidence to support a Pennsylvania postal worker‚Äôs claim that his supervisors had tampered with mail-in ballots during the presidential election**. Richard Hopkins initially alleged that he overheard plans to backdate ballots received after Nov. 3 and pass them off as legitimate. Hopkins later released a sworn affidavit recanting those allegations. Lindsey Graham and other Republicans, however, repeatedly cited the initial allegation to press baseless claims of voter fraud in the election. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/17/usps-ballot-fraud-investigation/))

4/ **A dozen House Republicans voted against awarding Congressional Gold Medals to three police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol when it was attacked by a pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6**. Several of the lawmakers objected to the use of the term ‚Äúinsurrectionists‚Äù in the resolution, while others objected to the use of the word ‚Äútemple" to describe the Capitol. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/17/dozen-republicans-voted-against-congressional-gold-medals-police-who-protected-them-jan-6/))

5/ **21 Republican-led states sued Biden for [revoking](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/01/21/day-2/#1-biden-marked-the-start-of-his-pres) the Keystone XL oil pipeline permit**. The lawsuit alleges that Biden exceeded his authority to revoke the permit because of a 2011 provision that required Obama to approve the pipeline or issue a determination that it wasn't in the national interest. Obama ultimately rejected the application, but Trump approved it. Biden then revoked the approval. Several of the states aren't even near the proposed pipeline path.

6/ **The Senate confirmed Xavier Becerra as health and human services secretary**, the first Latino to lead the department. The vote was 50-49. Susan Collins was the only Republican to support Becerra's nomination.

7/ **The Senate confirmed William Burns to be Biden's CIA director**. Ted Cruz had delayed Burns' nomination in an effort to pressure the Biden administration to issue sanctions to stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany. After Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued a ‚Äústrong declaration‚Äù suggesting future sanctions, Cruz said he would no longer delay Senate confirmation.

8/ **New York prosecutors investigating Trump‚Äôs business practices sent new subpoenas to local governments near Trump‚Äôs Seven Springs** as part of an inquiry into whether the value of the Westchester County property was improperly inflated to reduce his taxes. District Attorney Cyrus Vance‚Äôs office has also subpoenaed material from people who worked with Trump to develop the property. Meanwhile, the Manhattan district attorney‚Äôs office is scheduled to meet again with Michael Cohen for the eighth time.

9/ **Putin wished Biden ‚Äúgood health‚Äù after he agreed that the Russian leader was a ‚Äúkiller.‚Äù** Biden also pledged that the Kremlin is ‚Äúgoing to pay‚Äù for Russian interference in the 2020 election, which was detailed in a declassified intelligence report. Russia recalled its Washington ambassador after Biden‚Äôs comments, and warned of the possibility of an ‚Äúirreversible deterioration of relations.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/world/europe/russia-biden-putin-killer.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-usa-reaction-idUSKBN2BA0S1) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/18/europe/biden-putin-killer-comment-russia-reaction-intl/))
