3/ **While lawmakers are close to a $900 billion coronavirus stimulus deal, Congress is preparing for the possibility of a short government shutdown**. Lawmakers have to pass a government funding and pandemic rescue package before federal funding lapses at 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday. Republican leaders reportedly want to pass a stop-gap spending bill to extend the current government funding deadline an additional 48 hours, but Democrats want to pressure negotiators to come up with a deal by Friday night. The draft coronavirus proposal includes $600 in payments for individuals, $300-per-week in supplemental unemployment payments, aid for small businesses, and about $17 billion for airlines. It does not include aid for state and local governments or lawsuit liability protection. About 12 million people are set to lose benefits if pandemic-era provisions to expand unemployment eligibility expire and millions country could face eviction if a federal moratorium expires at the end of the year.
