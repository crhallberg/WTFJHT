1/ **House Speaker Mike Johnson promised a ‚Äúmassive reform‚Äù of the Affordable Care Act if Trump is reelected and Republicans retain control of the House**. ‚ÄúHealth care reform‚Äôs going to be a big part of the agenda," Johnson told the crowd at a rally in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. ‚ÄúWhen I say we‚Äôre going to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda, we got a lot of things still on the table.‚Äù When an attendee asked Johnson, ‚ÄúNo Obamacare?‚Äù Johnson, rolling his eyes, replied: ‚ÄúNo Obamacare. The ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.‚Äù Trump, meanwhile, has only offered that he has ‚Äúconcepts of a plan‚Äù when it came to replacing the Affordable Care Act. Trump tried and [failed](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/07/28/day-190/#1-trump%E2%80%99s-hardball-tactics-backfired) to repeal the ACA as president. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-criticizes-obamacare-promises-massive-reform-trump-win-rcna177853) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/30/mike-johnson-trump-aca-obamacare/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/politics/aca-obamacare-mike-johnson-trump.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/politics/johnson-obamacare-trump/index.html))

2/ **Trump promised to give Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù of several public health agencies, and appoint Elon Musk to a new ‚Äúgovernment efficiency commission‚Äù that would ‚Äúnecessarily involve some temporary hardship.‚Äù** Kennedy, an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, said his agenda would be ‚Äúmaking America healthy‚Äù through the "control of the public health agencies, which are HHS and its sub-agencies, CDC, FDA, NIH and a few others, and then also the USDA [...] Because we‚Äôve got to get off of seed oils, and we‚Äôve got to get off of pesticide intensive agriculture.‚Äù During the racist campaign rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, Trump said he would let Kennedy ‚Äúgo wild on the medicines.‚Äù Musk, meanwhile, agreed that Trump‚Äôs plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, extend his 2017 tax cuts, eliminate the personal income tax, and impose blanket tariffs up to 20% on all imported goods  would ‚Äúnecessarily involve some temporary hardship" to ‚Äúensure long-term prosperity.‚Äù Economists widely agree that Trump‚Äôs economic and fiscal proposals would ‚Äúlead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality,‚Äù as well as undermine the rule of law and political certainty. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/rfk-trump-control-hhs-usda/index.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/economy-if-trump-wins-second-term-could-mean-hardship-for-americans-rcna177807) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-economy-hardship.html) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/robert-f-kennedy-jr-control-cdc-trump_n_6721f8fbe4b03a564e7cbb96) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/elon-musk-trumps-economic-plans-cause-temporary-hardship/story?id=115316405) / [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/10/robert-kennedy-donald-trump-make-america-healthy-again/))

3/ **The economy grew at an 2.8% annual rate during the third quarter**. While the GDP increase is at a slightly weaker pace than the second quarter‚Äôs 3% rate and below economists‚Äô expectations of 3.1%, the economy has outperformed expectations and defied every prediction of a recession under the Biden administration. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/economy/us-economy-gdp-q3/index.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/us-gdp-economy-third-quarter-2024-59bf100b) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/30/economy-robust-growth-00186247) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/30/gdp-report-q3-release-economy-inflation) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/business/economy/economy-gdp-report.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/us-gdp-q3-2024.html))

* **üí° Trump wants you to believe that the US economy is doing terribly**. It‚Äôs untrue. "Despite his claims to the contrary, unemployment is low, inflation is way down, and job growth is remarkably strong." ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/30/trump-biden-harris-us-economy))

4/ **Trump, if re-elected, plans to withhold federal grants from local law enforcement agencies that refuse to support his proposed mass deportation of undocumented immigrants**. To pressure local law enforcement agencies into cooperating, Trump plans to cut access to the Byrne JAG grant program, a major federal funding source for law enforcement that allocates over $250 million annually for policing, rehabilitation, and corrections. During his previous term, Trump cut these grants to sanctuary cities, leading to legal battles that delayed implementation until Biden restored the funds in 2021. Confident in the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, Trump‚Äôs campaign believes they can overcome legal challenges quickly if re-elected. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-considering-halting-federal-grants-police-decline-conduct-mass-d-rcna177541))

5/ **The Supreme Court allowed Virginia to remove about 1,600 people from the state‚Äôs voter registration rolls less than a week before the presidential election**. After a federal judge ruled that Virginia purged 1,600 people from the state's rolls too close to Election Day in violation of federal law, the Supreme Court granted Virginia's emergency appeal with no reasoning. The National Voter Registration Act doesn't allow states to make "systematic" changes to voter rolls within 90 days of a federal election to prevent any last-minute mistakes. Nevertheless, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order in August requiring daily updates to state voter rolls to remove suspected noncitizens. It‚Äôs illegal for noncitizens to vote, but studies have found that noncitizens voting is extremely rare.

* **The Trump campaign sued Pennsylvania's Bucks County Board of Elections over claims the county had "turned away voters" who were attempting to apply in person for a mail-in ballot**. Pennsylvania Common Court Pleas Judge Jeffrey Trauger granted a preliminary injunction to extend the in-person mail-in-ballot deadline to Nov. 1, finding that the county violated the state‚Äôs election code. The previous deadline had been Tuesday. The campaign had asked for one-day extension.

6/ **Biden referred to Trump's supporters as "garbage"** when responding to a question about the comedian who called Puerto Rico an "island of garbage" at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday. Although the White House has disputed that interpretation of the quote ‚Äì¬†"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters" ‚Äì Republicans immediately connected it to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2016 remark that Trump‚Äôs supporters were a ‚Äúbasket of deplorables.‚Äù Kamala Harris, meanwhile, distanced herself from the comments, saying "I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for." She added: "I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not. And as president of the United States, I will be a president for all Americans, whether you vote for me or not. That is my responsibility, and that‚Äôs the kind of work that I‚Äôve done my entire career. And I take it very seriously.‚Äù ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-says-strongly-disagrees-criticism-people-based-vote-rcna178013) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/30/biden-garbage-trump-supporters-puerto-rico) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/biden-trump-supporters-garbage/index.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/30/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/harris-response-biden-garbage-comments-00186236) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-garbage-comment/index.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/30/nx-s1-5172187/joe-biden-garbage-trump-puerto-rico) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/30/trump-harris-election-live-updates/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-30/harris-strongly-denounces-criticism-of-voters-after-biden-flap) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-distances-bidens-garbage-comment-strongly-disagree-criticizing/story?id=115313099) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/biden-sits-uncomfortably-on-the-campaigns-sidelines-a72915b7) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/harris-biden-trump-election-garbage-supporters-3d2ea66e3027ddc4bc2b30c13bf7b554))

7/ **Kamala Harris, delivering her closing message to a crowd of 75,000 people at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., urged Americans to embrace a ‚Äúnew generation of leadership.‚Äù** America, Harris argued, was born ‚Äúwhen we wrested freedom from a petty tyrant‚Äù and that over generations, Americans had fought threats both foreign and domestic to preserve that freedom. But, ‚Äúthey did not struggle, sacrifice and lay down their lives, only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms, only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant" ‚Äì a reference to Trump. The U.S. "is not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators," she said, but the "greatest idea humanity ever devised." The Ellipse is where Trump, on Jan. 6, 2021, encouraged his followers to march to the Capitol and ‚Äúfight like hell‚Äù to stop Congress from certifying Biden as president. ‚ÄúAmericans died as a result of that attack,‚Äù Harris said, noting that Trump‚Äôs response to his staff describing how protesters wanted to kill Mike Pence was reportedly, ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù Before she ended, she said: "It is time to turn the page on the drama and conflict, the fear and division." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/politics/harris-speech-ellipse-trump.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/29/harris-closing-argument-speech) / [The 19th](https://19thnews.org/2024/10/harris-closing-argument-national-mall/) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-speech-ellipse-donald-trump-2024-election/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-key-moments-ellipse-9337554579a61eb271b4f311e3610993) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/harris-trump-election-10-30-24))
