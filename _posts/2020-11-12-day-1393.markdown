1/ **Dr. Anthony Fauci urged Americans to ‚Äúdouble down‚Äù on precautions as the U.S. recorded more than 145,000 coronavirus cases Wednesday ‚Äì yet another record**. The nation's top infectious disease expert said that while ‚Äúhelp is on the way \[...\] it isn‚Äôt here yet," referring to the early results from the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine candidate, which was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 infections. The rise in infections comes with new highs in the number of deaths. The U.S. reported 1,549 deaths Wednesday ‚Äì the highest since May 14. Fauci, meanwhile, added that working alongside the Trump administration has been "very stressful."
