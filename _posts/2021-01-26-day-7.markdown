1/ **Global Covid-19 cases topped 100 million** ‚Äì¬†less than three months after the world hit 50 million cases and just over a year after the first confirmed U.S. case. The U.S. accounts for more than 25 million infections. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/global-covid-19-cases-top-100-million-new-strains-emerge-n1255544) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/world/coronavirus-100-million-cases-intl/index.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/covid-live-updates.html))

2/ **The Biden administration plans to purchase an additional 200 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine**, with the goal of having enough supply to vaccinate nearly the entire U.S. population by the end of the summer. The administration says it'll buy an additional 100 million doses each from Moderna and Pfizer. The purchases would be in addition to the 400 million combined doses the companies had already committed to providing to the U.S. and would increase available supply by 50%, bringing the total to 600 doses by this summer. Weekly allocations of coronavirus vaccines will also increase by roughly 16% next week ‚Äì about 1.5 million additional doses. The weekly allocation is expected to go from about 8.6 million doses to about 10 million doses.

3/ **Mitch McConnell dropped his demand that Democrats promise to preserve the filibuster**, easing a stalemate that prevented new senators from being seated and party leaders from negotiating a power-sharing agreement. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer refused to meet McConnell‚Äôs demands. McConnell, however, said he received "assurances" from two centrist Democrats ‚Äì Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema ‚Äì that they opposed getting rid of the procedural tool Republicans could use to obstruct Biden‚Äôs agenda. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/us/senate-filibuster.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/26/960621238/mcconnell-relents-on-senate-filibuster-stalemate) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/25/joe-manchin-filibuster-462364) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mcconnell-relents-on-senate-rules-signals-power-sharing-deal-with-democrats/2021/01/25/fe4d1634-5f7c-11eb-9061-07abcc1f9229_story.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/politics-filibusters-kyrsten-sinema-joe-manchin-mitch-mcconnell-e2cc0c9fe29370b009277877604745e0) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-power-sharing-deal-moves-ahead-11611630763?mod=djemalertNEWS) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/politics/senate-republicans-power-sharing-deal/index.html))

4/ **The House formally delivered the article of impeachment to the Senate**, charging Trump with "incitement of insurrection" for his role in the deadly Capitol riot. House impeachment managers walked the article of impeachment through National Statuary Hall and the Capitol Rotunda to the Senate to present the article to the secretary of the Senate. Chief Justice John Roberts will not preside over the trial, like he did for Trump's first impeachment trial. Instead, Sen. Patrick Leahy, the president pro tempore of the Senate, will preside. Biden, [meanwhile](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/politics/joe-biden-trump-impeachment/index.html), said Trump's impeachment trial "has to happen" because there would be ‚Äúa worse effect if it didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù Trump is the first U.S. president to have been impeached twice and will be the first to be tried after leaving office. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-trump-impeachment/2021/01/25/e747ec76-5f26-11eb-9061-07abcc1f9229_story.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/house-deliver-trump-impeachment-article-senate-kicking-trial-preparations-n1255598) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/us/politics/house-impeachment-article-senate.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/trump-impeachment-trial-poised-to-open-with-march-across-capitol?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/politics/impeachment-article-senate-house/index.html))

5/ **Senate Republicans voted en masse in an attempt to dismiss the impeachment charge against Trump as unconstitutional because he is no longer in office**. All but five Republican senators endorsed the effort, signaling that the Senate does not have the votes to convict and that the proceedings will likely end with Trump‚Äôs acquittal. ‚ÄúImpeachment is for removal from office, and the accused here has already left office,‚Äù Rand Paul argued on the Senate floor earlier, adding that the trial would ‚Äúdrag our great country down into the gutter of rancor and vitriol, the likes of which has never been seen in our nation‚Äôs history.‚Äù To convict Trump, it would require 67 members of the 100-member Senate. Trump‚Äôs trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 9.

6/ **The Pentagon restricted the commander of the D.C. National Guard's authority ahead of the riot at the U.S. Capitol**, requiring higher-level sign-off to deploy the guard. Maj. Gen. William Walker told House Appropriations Committee  members that his authority to quickly deploy the guard was removed ahead of the riot and he needed approval from former Army secretary Ryan McCarthy and acting defense secretary Christopher Miller before dispatching troops. The acting chief of the Capitol Police, meanwhile, apologized to Congress for the security failures on Jan. 6, acknowledging that the department knew there was a ‚Äústrong potential for violence‚Äù but ‚Äúfailed to meet its own high standards" to prevent what she described as a ‚Äúterrorist attack.‚Äù Capitol Police officers are discussing holding a no-confidence vote targeting department leaders.
