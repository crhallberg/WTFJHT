1/ **Trump pledged to stay in the 2024 presidential race even if he's indicted**, saying "I am your retribution." Trump is facing two state investigations and two federal investigations: Prosecutors in Atlanta are considering charges against Trump over his efforts to pressure Georgia state officials to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden; the Justice Department is investigating Trump's actions related to the Jan. 6 insurrection; a Justice Department special counsel is also looking at his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House; and prosecutors in New York are looking at his past business practices, including alleged hush money payments to a former mistress. Trump, [meanwhile](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3883230-trump-easily-wins-cpac-straw-poll/), won the Conservative Political Action Conference's straw poll with 62% of the votes. His closest rival – Ron DeSantis – won 20% of the votes.

2/ **Trump asked a federal court to block Pence from testifying to a grand jury about his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, citing executive privilege**. The grand jury subpoena seeks documents and testimony from Pence related to the Jan. 6 events where pro-Trump rioters tried to disrupt the certification of Biden Electoral College victory by Congress. At the time, Pence was presiding over the certification proceedings as president of the Senate. Pence has claimed that because he was acting as president of the Senate that day, he is protected by the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause, which shields lawmakers from some law enforcement actions.

3/ **Paul Manafort agreed to pay $3.15 million to settle a civil case filed by the Justice Department** over his "willful failure to timely report his financial interest in foreign bank accounts.” Manafort failed to disclosed to the Treasury Department nearly two dozen bank accounts related to consulting work in Ukraine from 2006 to 2014.

4/ **A cancerous lesion was removed from Biden's chest during his physical last month** and all cancerous tissue was successfully removed, White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor said. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer with approximately 3.6 million cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year.

5/ **Since 2017, nearly three-quarters of all new debt was approved in bills supported by Republicans**, and three-fifths of it was signed into law by Trump, according to an analysis of House and Senate voting records and the fiscal estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO projects that the 13 new laws signed into law since 2017  will combine to add more than $11.5 trillion to the debt. Since 2000, the national debt has grown from under $6 trillion to $31.4 trillion. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/06/us/politics/federal-debt-republicans-democrats.html))
