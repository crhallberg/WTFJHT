1/ **Today is Super Tuesday**. Democrats and Republicans are casting ballots in 15 states for their party’s nominee for president, Senate, House, and governors races that can determine political control of Congress and states for the next two to four years. Over a third of the total delegates are up for grabs: 854 Republican delegates and 1,420 Democratic delegates. It takes 1,215 delegates to win the Republican nomination, while it takes 1,968 delegates to win the Democratic nomination. Trump is expected to widen his lead over Nikki Haley, while Biden is expected to sweep on the Democratic side. \[*Editor’s note: Check back tomorrow for a full recap on Super Tuesday 2024.*\] ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/super-tuesday-trump-biden-rematch-primaries-2024-e36971a222a2b50d35cb0a2c603ce4d5) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/03/05/super-tuesday-live-updates-election-2024/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/live-updates/super-tuesday-2024-states-results) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/05/us/super-tuesday-election-updates) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/super-tuesday-primary-03-05-24/index.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/super-tuesday-live-updates-rcna140438) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-03-05/super-tuesday-primaries?srnd=homepage-americas&sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/super-tuesday-primary-election-2024?mod=hp_lead_pos1))

* **Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema will not seek re-election**, setting up a race between Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake to succeed her. Sinema left the Democratic Party in 2022 to become an independent.

* **The number of Americans who think Trump committed serious federal crimes has declined since December** after steadily rising since the fall of 2022. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/us/politics/donald-trump-poll-crimes.html))

* **Do Americans have a "collective amnesia" about Trump?** "It’s only been three years, but memories of Trump’s presidency have faded and changed fast." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/us/politics/trump-presidency-election-voters.html))

* **Biden's new strategy: Go for Trump's jugular**. "Biden has told friends he thinks Trump is wobbly, both intellectually and emotionally, and will explode if Biden mercilessly gigs and goads him — 'go haywire in public,' as one adviser put it.

2/ **The Supreme Court temporarily blocked a new Texas immigration law**, which allow state police to arrest, jail, and prosecute migrants suspected of illegally crossing the U.S. border. Justice Samuel Alito issued the administrative hold, which will block the law from taking effect until March 13, after civil rights groups and the Department of Justice sued, arguing the law is unconstitutional and could lead to racial profiling. The Justice Department also said the law would “profoundly” alter the status quo “that has existed between the United States and the States in the context of immigration for almost 150 years.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/biden-administration-asks-supreme-court-block-texas-immigration-law-rcna141761) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/04/politics/texas-immigration-law-supreme-court-appeal/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-04/supreme-court-asked-to-block-law-letting-texas-deport-migrants?srnd=politics-vp&sref=MIBMEEoj))

3/ **The U.S. continued to airdrop aid into Gaza as the humanitarian crisis deepens**. The Biden administration said it’s working to increase the delivery of humanitarian aid  “through as many channels as possible,” because “the situation is simply intolerable." Biden, meanwhile, said that a possible six-week ceasefire in Gaza is “in the hands of Hamas right now," adding: “We need a ceasefire.” Israel, Hamas, and mediators want to secure a deal before March 10, the start of Ramadan, the holiest period in the Islamic calendar, which is observed by a month of fasting.

4/ **The Biden administration will cap all credit card late fees at $8**, which regulators say will save Americans up to $10 billion a year. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule will close a legal loophole that had allowed some financial services to charge an average of $32 per month for a missed or late payment. Biden also announced the formation of a new "strike force" meant to crack down on “junk fees,” and other "anti-competitive, unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent business practices" on things like  groceries, prescription drugs, health care, housing and financial services.
