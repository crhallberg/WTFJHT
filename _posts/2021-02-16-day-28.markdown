1/ **The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee sued Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and two extremist groups**, accusing them of conspiring to incite the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in order to interfere with Congress' certification of the Electoral College count. The lawsuit, filed by the NAACP on behalf of Rep. Bennie Thompson, alleges that Trump and Giuliani, in collaboration with the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, violated the Ku Klux Klan Act, an 1871 statute designed to protect lawmakers from violent interference in Congress‚Äôs constitutional duties. The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, says that by repeatedly claiming that the election was stolen, Trump and Giuliani ‚Äúendorsed rather than discouraged‚Äù threats of violence from his supporters in the weeks leading up to the assault on the Capitol. And, at the Jan. 6 rally near the White House, the two "began stoking the crowd's anger and urging them to take action to forcibly seize control of the process for counting and approving the Electoral College ballots."

2/ **The White House said Biden would support efforts to establish the creation of a "9/11-type commission" to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol**. Nancy Pelosi said Monday that the House would move to establish an independent commission for Congress to ‚Äúget to the truth‚Äù of the Capitol attack as well as ‚Äúthe interference with the peaceful transfer of power.‚Äù Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the White House would also cooperate with Congress to deter similar episodes in the future.

3/ **House Democrats are finalizing the details of Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package**, aiming to vote on final legislation Feb. 26. Currently, the legislation would provide billions of dollars for schools and small businesses, extend unemployment benefits through the fall, provide $1,400 in direct payments, and gradually increase in the federal minimum wage to $15. While the full House could pass the legislation as soon as next week, two Democrats in the Senate have voiced opposition to raising the federal minimum wage. Any changes made in the Senate would mean that the bill would have to go back to the House for another vote.
