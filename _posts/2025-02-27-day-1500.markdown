1/ **A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration can fire dozens of CIA and intelligence officers who had worked on diversity programs**. Judge Anthony Trenga said the decision was "a difficult situation," but said the law grants CIA Director John Ratcliffe broad authority to dismiss employees "in the interests of the United States." The officers had sued to be reassigned to other positions instead of being terminated. The ruling clears the way for at least 51 intelligence officers to be dismissed, though the judge suggested they be allowed to apply for other jobs.

2/ **Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily allowed the Trump administration to keep foreign aid funds frozen while the Supreme Court reviews the issue**. The decision came after the administration failed to meet a midnight deadline set by U.S. District Judge Amir Ali to release nearly $2 billion in aid payments. The judge had ruled that the administration was unlawfully blocking aid despite earlier court orders, but the government argued that logistical challenges made compliance impossible. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris claimed the freeze was necessary for reviewing contracts and ensuring funds were properly allocated. Roberts’ ruling delays enforcement of Ali’s order until at least Friday, when aid groups must respond to the government’s request.

3/ **The Trump administration will cut more than 90% of USAID’s foreign aid contracts**, eliminating $60 billion in global assistance. The cuts will affect 5,800 of 6,200 USAID contracts and 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants. The administration claims it is reducing “waste” and refocusing aid on U.S. interests. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/27/trump-administration-to-cut-92-of-usaid-foreign-aid-contracts))

4/ **The Trump administration canceled an FDA vaccine advisory meeting to determine the composition of next season’s flu shots**. This is the second federal vaccine panel meeting canceled since Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, became Health and Human Services secretary. The meeting is a key step in ensuring flu vaccines are ready by fall, as manufacturers require months to produce them. The FDA didn’t provide a reason for the cancellation but said it "will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/26/fda-cancels-vaccine-meeting-flu/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-27/trump-administration-cancels-meeting-of-fda-vaccine-advisers) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/fda-cancels-vaccine-advisory-meeting-for-choosing-flu-shots.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/news-fda-meeting-to-choose-flu-vaccine-composition-canceled-without-explanation/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/fda-flu-vaccine.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-cancels-meeting-select-flu-strains-seasons-shots-rcna193931))

* **Elon Musk claimed USAID’s Ebola prevention efforts were restored after being “accidentally canceled,”** but officials say key programs remain frozen. Disease response teams have been gutted, funding halted, and experts warn the cuts weaken global health security. The White House did not confirm full restoration. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/27/g-s1-50929/elon-musk-ebola-usaid))

5/ **Trump said 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will take effect on March 4, along with an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods** – bringing the total levy on some Chinese imports to 20%. The move follows a one-month pause on North American tariffs after Canada and Mexico pledged new border security measures. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have warned of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Economists, meanwhile, predict the tariffs will raise consumer prices, worsen inflation, and disrupt supply chains, with U.S. auto and manufacturing industries among the hardest hit. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/27/trump-tariffs-china) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-71761a2894e13a050717afda4fd8131a) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-00002714) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5299291/trump-tariffs-infrastructure-week) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/politics/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/trump-says-mexico-canada-tariffs-will-start-march-4-plus-additional-10percent-on-china.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-27/trump-says-canada-mexico-tariffs-to-take-effect-new-china-duty) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-plans-another-10-tariff-on-products-from-china-f7c0d4d9) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/27/trump-tariffs-canada-china-mexico/))

6/ **U.S. jobless claims rose to 242,000 last week** – the highest in three months. While the labor market remains strong – with unemployment at 4% and 143,000 jobs added in January – the four-week average of Americans filing for jobless benefits climbed to 224,000, reflecting a steady increase in layoffs. Economists attribute part of the rise to ongoing layoffs in the federal workforce. Analysts expect more layoffs tied to federal downsizing to appear in upcoming reports. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/number-americans-filing-unemployment-benefits-rises-242000-highest-119249503) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/unemployment-benefits-jobless-claims-layoffs-labor-a4b9beab0c8a16c374ed5492f02a61f6) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/economy/us-jobless-claims-layoffs/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-27/us-initial-jobless-claims-rise-to-highest-level-this-year) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/weekly-jobless-claims-jump-to-242000-more-than-expected-in-latest-sign-of-economic-softening.html))


7/ **The FAA is considering canceling a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon to modernize air traffic control communications and awarding it to Elon Musk’s Starlink**. Musk, who leads the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, has criticized Verizon’s system as failing, though he provided no evidence. SpaceX employees have reportedly been working inside the FAA, some with FAA email addresses, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. ([Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/faa-might-drop-verizon-for-starlink-as-elon-musk-controls-u-s-government-2000569321) / [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/620777/starlink-verizon-contract-faa-communication-musk) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/26/musk-starlink-doge-faa-verizon/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/business/elon-musk-faa-air-traffic-control-failing-spacex/index.html))

*The midterm elections are in 614 days.*

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The Trump administration is preparing its largest round of federal layoffs yet**, targeting entire job categories and shrinking agency workforces. The General Services Administration warned employees of imminent terminations, while the Social Security Administration has been ordered to cut staff by 50%, and a Labor Department office enforcing equal employment laws faces a 90% reduction. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/26/doge-federal-workforce-firings-job-cuts/))

2. **Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard fired more than 100 intelligence officers across 15 agencies for participating in government chatrooms that included discussions on polyamory, gender transition surgery, and politics**. Gabbard called the activity an “egregious violation of trust” and ordered their security clearances revoked. The chat platform is managed by the National Security Agency. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/gabbard-fires-100-intelligence-officers-messages-chat-tool-rcna193799) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/gabbard-nsa-firing-explicit-chat.html))

3. **The Pentagon ordered all military branches to begin removing transgender service members**, expanding an earlier Trump administration policy that restricted transgender enlistment. A newly released memo states that troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria or those who have undergone gender transition will be discharged within 60 days. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/27/us-moves-to-remove-transgender-troops-from-military-pentagon-memo-shows) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/transgender-military-trump-ban-troops-deb9e388ff588d9d25fb0d8cc58e540f) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/27/transgender-ban-us-service-members-military-pentagon/))

4. **Trump said he believes Putin "keep his word" and honor any peace deal reached to end the war in Ukraine**. Speaking alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump said "I’ve known [Putin] for a long time now," saying “We had to go through the Russian hoax together. They had to put up with that, too. They put up with a lot." While Starmer urged Trump to ensure strong security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump made no commitments, instead suggesting that Europe should take primary responsibility for Ukraine’s security.

5. **The Senate voted 52-47 to overturn an EPA rule that required oil companies to pay fees for emitting methane**, a potent greenhouse gas. The House passed a similar resolution, and Trump is expected to sign it. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/27/methane-fee-senate-vote-trump/))

6. **The Global Democracy Index hit a historic low in 2024**, with more than one-third of the world now under authoritarian rule. The U.S. remains a "flawed democracy", downgraded in 2016 due to low trust in institutions, political gridlock, and lobbyist influence.
