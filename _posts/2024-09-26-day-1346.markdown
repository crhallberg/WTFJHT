1/ **Federal prosecutors charged New York City Mayor Eric Adams with bribery, fraud, and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations** as part of months-long federal investigation into whether his campaign illegally conspired with Turkish entities to collect foreign donations. According to the five-count indictment, Adams accepted free travel on Turkish Airlines, illegal campaign contributions, and other perks from his ‚Äúcorrupt relationships‚Äù with rich foreigners connected to the Turkish government. In exchange, prosecutors allege that Adams used his position as incoming mayor to influence the opening of the Turkish consulate in Manhattan by expediting the fire safety inspection despite safety concerns, as well as not releasing a statement on Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day ‚Äì the annual observance of the estimated 1.5 million Armenians, who were systematically exterminated through mass deportations, forced marches, and mass killings. Adams, meanwhile, said he would not resign.

2/ **Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden introduced legislation to add six justices to the Supreme Court, require supermajorities to overturn any law passed by Congress, require justices to undergo audits, and more**. ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court is in crisis and bold solutions are necessary to restore the public trust,‚Äù Wyden said in a statement. ‚ÄúMore transparency, more accountability and more checks on a power hungry Supreme Court are just what the American people are asking for.‚Äù The bill would increase the number of justices from nine to 15 over 12 years to prevent one  political party from packing the courts with its nominees. In addition, the legislation would require Supreme Court nominees to be automatically scheduled for a vote in the Senate  to prevent senators from refusing to hold a vote on a nominee ‚Äì like what Mitch McConnell did to Obama‚Äôs nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an atomic secret that the process for selecting justices is politicized,‚Äù Wyden said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this thoroughly politicized process resulting in a Supreme Court that now frequently issues sweeping rulings to overturn laws and upend precedents. We are proposing a way to restore some balance between the three branches of government.‚Äù The bill, however, stands little chance of passing in the Republican-controlled House.

3/ **Rudy Giuliani was disbarred from practicing law in Washington, D.C., over his efforts to overturn Trump‚Äôs 2020 election loss**. An ethics panel recommended Giuliani be disbarred, saying: "He sought to disrupt a presidential election and persists in his refusal to acknowledge the wrong he has done." Giuliani was also recently disbarred in New York.

4/ **Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue his bombardment of Hezbollah targets in Lebanon indefinitely despite the U.S. and other allies calling for a 21-day ceasefire**. Netanyahu's said the IDF will keep "fighting with full force," adding: ‚ÄúWe continue to hit Hezbollah with all our might. This is the policy.‚Äù Israeli airstrikes and attacks have killed more than 700 people, including many women and children, in Lebanon over the past 10 days. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging rocket fire since the start of the war in Gaza. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, and are designated terrorist organizations by the U.S. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-26/us-and-allies-race-to-stop-unfolding-lebanon-war-with-truce-plan) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-26-2024-486f5aecac210273611124f9ade95fc6) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/26/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/26/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-cease-fire-strikes-rcna172793) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-09-26-24-intl-hnk/index.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-casts-doubt-on-hezbollah-cease-fire-as-it-launches-more-airstrikes-f31c3b05) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/26/lebanon-israel-ceasefire-deal-netanyahu))

5/ **Republican Rep. Clay Higgins deleted his racist social media post** calling Haiti the "nastiest country in the western hemisphere" after being confronted by multiple House colleagues who threatened to censure him. In Higgins' social media rant, he called Haitians ‚Äúthugs,‚Äù repeated Trump and JD Vance‚Äôs false and dehumanizing claims about pet-eating, falsely claimed ‚Äúwild‚Äù Haitians were practicing ‚Äúvudu,‚Äù and called Haitian migrants ‚Äúthugs' and ‚Äúslapstick gangsters‚Äù who needed to get ‚Äútheir ass out of our country.‚Äù He later doubled down that ‚Äúit‚Äôs all true,‚Äù when asked about his now-deleted post. Congressional Black Caucus Chair Rep. Steven Horsford plans to force action on a censure resolution when the House returns after the November election.
