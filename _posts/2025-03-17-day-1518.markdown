1/ **Trump signed a six-month government funding bill on Saturday, preventing a shutdown but exposing deep fractures among Democrats**. The Senate passed the $1.7 trillion measure 54-46, with 10 Democrats breaking ranks to help Republicans overcome a filibuster despite weeks of opposition from House Democrats. The bill includes $13 billion in domestic spending cuts and a $6 billion defense boost, handing the Trump administration broad discretion over the budget. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who initially opposed the bill for giving Trump unchecked power to slash federal programs, abruptly reversed course and backed it, arguing that “as bad as passing the [continuing resolution] is, allowing Donald Trump to take even more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.” House Democrats, who saw blocking the bill as their best leverage, reacted with outrage. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the move a “slap in the face,” warning it gave Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency a “blank check” to gut social services. Schumer, however, defended his decision, claiming a shutdown would have allowed Trump to “shift into overdrive” in slashing federal programs and “nonessential” workers. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries refused to defend Schumer’s leadership, dismissing questions with “Next question.” Trump, meanwhile, celebrated the bill’s passage, praising Schumer for showing “guts and courage.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/nx-s1-5328229/senate-spending-bill-vote-government-shutdown) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-funding-59d49f0e358d0f68bba47716f37bc3a6) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-vote-republican-funding-bill-government-shutdown-rcna196412) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-15/trump-signs-government-funding-bill-to-avert-federal-shutdown) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/14/us/trump-government-shutdown-news) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/government-shutdown-vote-democrats-schumer-71d05db7) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/schumers-shutdown-u-turn-deepens-democratic-party-divide-db279a95) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/14/house-democrats-chuck-schumer-shutdown) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/14/senate-democrats-government-shutdown-cr/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/democrats-congress-chuck-schumer-government-funding-shutdown-43d1acea20c34ad28d848edc08ad6375) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democratic-anger-schumer-surrender-shows-partys-deep-divisions-take-tr-rcna196370) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/14/schumer-democrats-anger-shutdown-fight-00231908) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/13/chuck-schumer-surrender-shutdown-00230481) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/pelosi-comes-out-against-schumer-s-government-shutdown-retreat) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/why-schumer-broke-with-democrats-in-shutdown-fight-071f993b) / [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/dem-civil-war-erupts-over-government-shutdown-as-aoc-and-chuck-schumer-go-at-it/) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-chuck-schumer-hakeem-jeffries-government-shutdown_n_67d473ece4b034e451a5db9f))

2/ **Trump signed an executive order to dismantle seven federal agencies**, including the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Free Asia. The order directed agencies to cut operations to “the minimum presence and function required by law.” Over 1,300 journalists at Voice of America were placed on administrative leave, effectively silencing the U.S.-funded media outlet that has long countered authoritarian propaganda abroad. Trump loyalist Kari Lake, now a senior adviser at USAGM, called the agency “not salvageable,” while former VOA director Michael Abramowitz said the move “silences a vital voice for democracy.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/trump-order-voice-of-america.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/15/trump-voa-environment-executive-orders/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-issues-executive-order-to-dismantle-several-programs-including-voice-of-america-d9676cda) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5196704-trump-executive-order-federal-agencies-eliminate/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/15/nx-s1-5329244/bloody-saturday-voiceofamerica-radio-free-asia-europe-trump-kari-lake) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/15/donald-trump-agency-cuts-00232119) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-voice-of-america-cuts-3faf72e620dbc5f42e5508a2b9d8c8da) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/media/voice-of-america-trump-cuts) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-signs-order-gut-voice-america-other-agencies-2025-03-15/))

3/ **Trump turned a Justice Department speech into a spectacle of grievance, attacking prosecutors as “scum” and vowing to "expose" his enemies, and “expel the rogue actors and corrupt forces” from government**. He called the classified documents case against him as “bullshit,” praised Judge Aileen Cannon for throwing it out, and called the FBI agents who investigated him part of a “corrupt group of hacks and radicals.” Declaring himself the nation’s “chief law enforcement officer,” Trump claimed his predecessors had turned the DOJ into the “Department of Injustice” and insisted that “those days are over, and they are never coming back.” His administration has already fired prosecutors, demanded FBI personnel lists, and dismissed charges against political allies. As Attorney General Pam Bondi put it: “We are so proud to work at the directive of Donald Trump.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-visits-justice-department-e9091e3721adda4d3ed39bd15119a0d4) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-calls-jailing-perceived-opponents-justice-department-speech-rcna196515) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/14/trump-doj-speech-prison-opponents-00231438) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-makes-political-show-of-force-in-justice-department-visit-df623fad) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/14/trump-justice-department-speech/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-speech-justice-department.html))

4/ **Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify the rapid deportation of Venezuelan nationals accused of gang ties** – an unprecedented move outside of wartime. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, however, blocked the deportations, ordering flights already in transit to return, but the Trump administration refused to comply. White House officials argued the judge had no authority and claimed the deportees had already left U.S. jurisdiction. Trump’s border czar Tom Homan dismissed the ruling, saying, “We’re not stopping,” while Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed that courts “have no jurisdiction” over Trump’s immigration actions. The administration is now attempting to remove Boasberg from the case, escalating the legal standoff.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to allow its executive order ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors**. Lower courts ruled the policy unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. Trump’s lawyers argue injunctions should apply only to suing states, allowing partial enforcement. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/13/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-trump/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/trump-takes-plan-end-birthright-citizenship-supreme-court-rcna196314) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship-supreme-court.html))

2. **Trump ordered large-scale military strikes on Houthi-controlled sites in Yemen in response to the group's attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes**. The strikes targeted radar systems, air defenses, and drone launch sites, and marks the largest U.S. military action in the region since Trump took office. Further, Trump warned Iran to end its support for the Houthis or face consequences, declaring that “We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.” Houthi officials reported at least 24 killed, including civilians, and vowed retaliation. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-launches-strikes-against-yemens-houthis-warns-iran-2025-03-15/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-yemen-houthis-rebels-attack-airstrike-11b0e080b3982542dd621338a7b18afd) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/us-attack-houthis.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-15/trump-orders-military-action-against-houthi-fighters-in-yemen) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/15/trump-yemen-houthis-iran/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/15/us-air-strikes-houthis-yemen))

3. **Trump threatened to revoke all federal funding to Columbia unless it meets his demands**, including placing the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under academic receivership for five years. The ultimatum also requires banning face masks on campus, revising student discipline policies, adopting a new definition of antisemitism, and overhauling admissions practices. The move follows the withdrawal of $400 million in federal grants, with $5 billion more under review, due to Columbia’s alleged failure to combat perceived antisemitism. ([PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/trump-demands-admissions-overhaul-and-control-of-academic-department-at-columbia-university) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/nyregion/columbia-university-students-disciplined-hamilton-hall.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-trump-federal-funding-demands-0c6f7078))

4. **EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the closure of all environmental justice offices and the rollback of over 30 environmental regulations**, calling it "the most consequential day of deregulation in American history." He dismissed environmental justice efforts as "forced discrimination programs" and framed his agenda as freeing businesses from rules he characterized as burdensome. The changes include eliminating emissions standards for power plants and vehicles, along with reconsidering the EPA’s legal basis for regulating climate pollution. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/epa-rollback-environmental-regulations-zeldin-rcna196112) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-epa-climate-zeldin-power-plants-feb184286a7a9419aefddce293362e6b) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/climate/epa-closure-environmental-justice-offices.html))

5. **Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the Trump administration’s economic policies despite the sharp stock market downturn and growing recession concerns**. While acknowledging the risk of financial instability, Bessent insisted that spending cuts, deregulation, and tariffs would put the economy on a “sustainable path.” The S&P 500, however, entered correction territory after Trump’s tariff threats, though Bessent dismissed market volatility as “healthy.” The federal deficit, meanwhile, surpassed $1 trillion in February. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/16/treasury-secretary-bessent-says-white-house-is-heading-off-financial-crisis.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-16/bessent-says-he-s-not-worried-about-market-corrections-healthy) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/treasury-scott-bessent-not-worried-stock-market-selloff-rcna196608) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/16/bessent-stock-market-correction-healthy) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/16/treasury-secretary-bessent-recession-no-guarantees/82468575007/))

6. **U.S. consumer sentiment fell 11% in March – its lowest since 2022** – reflecting concerns over Trump’s tariffs, government layoffs, and economic uncertainty. Inflation expectations jumped, with consumers forecasting 4.9% inflation over the next year – the highest since late 2022. Market volatility also continued, with the S&P 500 entering correction territory on Thursday before rebounding Friday. Economists warned that weak sentiment could dampen spending, while the Federal Reserve faces pressure over whether to cut interest rates.
