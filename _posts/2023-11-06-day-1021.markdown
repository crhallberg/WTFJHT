1/ **Trump repeatedly provided off topic testimony, lost his temper, and attacked the judge overseeing his $250 million civil fraud case,** saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible thing you‚Äôve done. You know nothing about me." Trump called New York Attorney General Letitia James ‚Äúa political hack‚Äù and her prosecutors "all haters," complaining that this is ‚Äúa very unfair trial.‚Äù The outburst prompted New York Judge Arthur Engoron to direct Trump's lawyers to "control him," saying ‚Äúthis is not a political rally, this is a courtroom.‚Äù James accused Trump and his co-defendants of a decade-long scheme to use "numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation" to inflate Trump's net worth in order get more favorable loan terms. Engoron has already ruled that Trump is liable for fraud, and the trial is meant to determine what damages Trump will pay. Nevertheless, Trump complained during testimony that Engoron ‚Äúcalled me a fraud and he didn‚Äôt know anything about me.‚Äù Engoron suggested that Trump read the order where he found him liable for fraud.

2/ **A federal appeals court lifted a gag order imposed on Trump in the election subversion criminal case**, temporarily allowing him to go back to disparaging prosecutors, witnesses, and court staffers involved in the proceeding. The pause will last about two weeks as the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia considers Trump's claim that the limited gag order violates his First Amendment rights.

3/ **United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres warned that Gaza is "becoming a graveyard for children,"** saying "the unfolding catastrophe makes the need for a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent with every passing hour." More than 1.5 million people have been displaced and more than 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel‚Äôs bombardment began four weeks ago, according to the Gaza Health Ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Israel says 1,400 people were killed in the Hamas terror attack, and that 240 are still held hostage. Israel, however, rejected the Biden administration's calls for a humanitarian cease-fire, saying it will continue to bombard the Gaza Strip with ‚Äúall of its power.‚Äù Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [added](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/netanyahu-abcs-muir-cease-fire-release-hostages/story?id=104661239) that "there'll be no cease-fire \[...\] in Gaza without the release of our hostages," saying "It'll hamper our effort to get our hostages out because the only thing that works on these criminals in Hamas is the military pressure that we're exerting." Israel's military, meanwhile, has ‚Äúcompleted our encirclement" of Gaza City ‚Äì effectively splitting the Gaza Strip in half ‚Äì and was carrying out ‚Äúa significant operation‚Äù as it carried out "a large attack on terrorist infrastructure both below and above ground."

4/ **The Biden administration has reportedly become deeply "uncomfortable" and "distressed" with some of Israel‚Äôs tactics**, saying the "counterattack against Hamas has been too severe, too costly in civilian casualties, and lacking a coherent endgame." A person familiar with the administration‚Äôs thinking said the White House has been skeptical of an Israeli ground invasion and concerned that "the situation inside Gaza would only get worse for the people there, and that would lead to escalation. They‚Äôre just trying different ways of, 'How do you mitigate a set of actions that are inevitable and won‚Äôt work and will fail?'" State Department staffers, meanwhile, issued a memo that argues the Biden administration should be willing to publicly criticize Israel's military tactics and its treatment of Palestinians. ‚ÄúWe must publicly criticize Israel‚Äôs violations of international norms such as failure to limit offensive operations to legitimate military targets,‚Äù the memo states. ‚ÄúWhen Israel supports settler violence and illegal land seizures or employs excessive use of force against Palestinians, we must communicate publicly that this goes against our American values so that Israel does not act with impunity.‚Äù The document also says the administration's private and public messaging ‚Äúcontributes to regional public perceptions that the United States is a biased and dishonest actor, which at best does not advance, and at worst harms, U.S. interests worldwide.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/05/white-house-resigned-israel-onslaught-gaza/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/06/u-s-diplomats-slam-israel-policy-in-leaked-memo-00125538))
