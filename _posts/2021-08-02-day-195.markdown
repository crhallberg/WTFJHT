2/ **Lindsey Graham tested positive for COVID-19 and has had "flu-like symptoms," despite being vaccinated.** Graham announced Monday that he now has only "mild symptoms" and is very glad he had been vaccinated because "without vaccination I am certain I would not feel as well as I do now."

3/ **House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy joked that "it will be hard not to hit" Nancy Pelosi with the gavel if he becomes House speaker**. "I want you to watch Nancy Pelosi hand me that gavel.
