1/ **The Supreme Court temporarily extended access to the abortion pill mifepristone until at least Friday**, freezing a lower court order that had invalidated the FDA's approval of mifepristone more than two decades ago. In an order signed by Justice Samuel Alito, the court said it will act by Friday night. The Supreme Court is considering emergency appeals from the Biden administration and the brand-name manufacturer of the pill about whether to block a decision by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who revoked the FDA's approval of mifepristone altogether. A federal appeals court later modified Kacsmaryk's ruling so that mifepristone would remain available while the case continues, but blocked the drug from being mailed or dispensed as a generic and required patients to make three in-person visits with a doctor.

2/ **The company that supplies two-thirds of mifepristone in the U.S. sued the FDA to keep its generic version of the abortion pill on the market**. GenBioPro seeks to preemptively block the FDA from suspending approval of the drug if the courts order mifepristone off the market, arguing that the FDA can't suspend its approval without finding an “imminent hazard to public health.” GenBioPro's lawsuit adds that "the result will be chaos" if the FDA revokes approval of generic mifepristone, and that "upending nearly a quarter-century of public reliance on a safe and effective drug" would cause "catastrophic harm" to the company, doctors, and patients who rely on the drug.

3/ **The Florida Board of Education expanded its ban on classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity**, extending the restrictions from kindergarten through high school. The rule builds on the Parental Rights in Education law Florida, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed in March 2022, that banned classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity for students in kindergarten through third grade. Under the updated rule, teachers who violate the ban risk losing their teaching licenses. The new guidelines were approved unanimously.

4/ **The Nebraska Legislature approved a measure to allow people to carry concealed guns without a permit**, removing the existing requirements for permits and training. While the bill doesn't remove federal background check requirements for buying a gun, but it does overrides stricter gun laws in the state’s cities. If signed by Gov. Jim Pillen, Nebraska would become the 26th state to allow people to carry concealed guns without a permit.

5/ **Republican lawmakers in Tennessee passed a bill to protect gun and ammunition dealers, manufacturers, and sellers from lawsuits** – weeks after the Nashville school shooting that killed six people, including three 9-year-olds. The measure heads to Gov. Bill Lee. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-gun-lawsuits-shooting-e35ded1be99d504b7ae1694ad030be17))
