1/ **Trump is expected to pardon or commute the sentences of more than 100 people on his final full day in the White House**. Trump met with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and other aides Sunday to review a list of pardon requests, including whether to issue preemptive pardons to his adult children, aides, and himself. Trump allies, meanwhile, have reportedly sold their access to the White House to lobby Trump and White House aides for pardons. While there is nothing illegal about Trump associates being paid to lobby for clemency, any explicit offers of payment to Trump in return could be be a possible violations of bribery laws.

2/ **The FBI is vetting all 25,000 National Guard troops in Washington tasked with securing the inauguration**. U.S. defense officials said they were concerned about an inside threat from service members.   Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said that the vetting process hasn‚Äôt flagged any issues with the troops.

* **Capitol Police warned three days before the Capitol riot that ‚ÄúCongress itself‚Äù could be targeted by Trump supporters on Jan. 6**. ‚ÄúSupporters of the current president see January 6, 2021, as the last opportunity to overturn the results of the presidential election,‚Äù according to the 12-page internal intelligence report. ‚ÄúThis sense of desperation and disappointment may lead to more of an incentive to become violent. Unlike previous post-election protests, the targets of the pro-Trump supporters are not necessarily the counter-protesters as they were previously, but rather Congress itself is the target on the 6th.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/capitol-police-intelligence-warning/2021/01/15/c8b50744-5742-11eb-a08b-f1381ef3d207_story.html))

* **The FBI is investigating whether foreign governments or groups helped fund the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol**, including payments of $500,000 in bitcoin to key figures in the alt-right.

3/ **The director of the Census Bureau resigned after whistleblower complaints warned that political appointees were pressuring staff to release "statistically indefensible" data on the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country by Jan. 15**, which could be "misinterpreted, misused, or otherwise tarnish the Bureau's reputation." Steven Dillingham's term was scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, 2021. Trump appointed Dillingham to lead the agency in 2019 as the Trump administration pushed to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census, which was ultimately blocked by the Supreme Court.

4/ **The National Security Agency moved to install a former GOP political operative and White House official as its general counsel**. Under pressure from the White House, Defense Secretary Christopher Miller ordered NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone to place Michael Ellis the role. Nakasone was reportedly not in favor of Ellis‚Äôs selection and tried to delay his installation. Ellis tried to prevent the release of a portion of John Bolton's, the former national security adviser, manuscript that dealt with Ukraine and would presumably be damaging to Trump. The Pentagon plans to swear Ellis in on Tuesday.

5/ **At least five anti-vaccine organization received more than $850,000 in loans from the federal Paycheck Protection Program**. The groups all oppose or question the safety of vaccination, and are known to spread misleading information about the coronavirus, raising questions about why the Trump administration approved loans to groups that actively opposed its own public health agenda. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/18/ppp-loans-anti-vaccine/))

6/ **By the time you read this, the number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. will have surpassed 400,000** and more than 2 million people worldwide will have been killed by the virus.  The U.S. confirmed its first case of the virus in Seattle on Jan. 21, 2020. As the total number of U.S. coronavirus cases surpassed 24 million, California health officials reported a new coronavirus variant linked to about 25% of new cases in the state. The new variant, known as L452R, is distinct from the highly contagious British mutation, known as B117, which has also been found in California.
