1/ **A federal appeals court upheld the $5 million verdict against Trump in the sexual abuse and defamation case brought by E. Jean Carroll**. Trump had asked for a new trial after a jury unanimously concluded in May 2023 that he sexually abused Carroll in the 1990s – and then defamed her after she went public with her allegations. Trump argued that the trial judge made a mistake by allowing the jury to hear the testimony of two women who accused him of sexual abuse, as well as the 2005 "Access Hollywood" recording in which he described kissing and grabbing women without their consent, saying: "I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything [...] Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything." The court, however, rejected Trump arguments, saying the evidence established a "repeated, idiosyncratic pattern of conduct" consistent with Carroll's allegations and that “[T]he jury could reasonably infer [...] that Mr. Trump engaged in similar conduct with other women — a pattern of abrupt, nonconsensual, and physical advances on women he barely knew.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/30/nx-s1-5243228/federal-appeal-trump-e-jean-carroll) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/appeals-court-rejects-trumps-attempt-overturn-jean-carroll/story?id=117198535) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/30/nyregion/trump-carroll-appeal-denied.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/12/30/trump-appeal-e-jean-carroll-defamation-sexual-abuse/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-loses-appeal-of-e-jean-carroll-sexual-abuse-verdict-37c98f08) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-carroll-lawsuit-defamation-trial-78e4196024539653a6de492312770ff2) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/30/appeals-court-upholds-verdict-against-trump-in-e-jean-carroll-sexual-abuse-case-00196116) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/appeals-court-upholds-5-million-e-jean-carroll-verdict-trump-rcna185745))

2/ **Trump endorsed Mike Johnson for another term**, saying he has his “complete and total” support. Trump added that Republicans should “NOT BLOW THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY WHICH WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN.” Johnson is running for re-election as speaker on Jan. 3 when the new Congress begins. Trump's endorsement comes as some House conservatives have warned they’re not committed to backing Johnson after he passed an end of year spending deal that lacked spending cuts and didn’t include Trump’s debt ceiling increase. Johnson can only afford to lose two Republican votes. Democrats are expected to universally oppose him, and Republican Thomas Massie has already signaled his opposition. Failure to elect a speaker by Jan. 6 could delay Trump’s Electoral College certification.

3/ **Trump sided with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy on H-1B visas over his MAGA acolytes**, who want to stop immigration and preserve jobs for American workers. After Trump appointed venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan, an Indian immigrant, to be his senior AI-policy adviser, MAGA activist Laura Loomer condemned the decision and declared it a “not America First policy.” Krishnan has called for increased access to green cards and making it easier for skilled foreign workers to come to the U.S. on H-1B temporary visas. Loomer called such workers “third world invaders” while Steve Bannon called H-1Bs a “scam.” Musk, who was born in South Africa and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, said that the reason he and others who built SpaceX and Tesla are in the U.S. is because of the H-1B program. “Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face,” Musk said in a post. “I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.” Musk also called for "those contemptible fools must be removed from the Republican Party.” [Bannon replied to Musk](https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-turns-maga-civil-war-nuclear-fk-yourself-in-the-face/): “Someone please notify ‘Child Protective Services’—need to do a ‘wellness check’ on this toddler.” [Ramaswamy also weighed in](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/12/elon-musk-vs-laura-loomer-maga-clashes-over-immigration/), arguing that “American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence.” Trump, meanwhile, weighed in and said: “I’ve always liked the visas. I have always been in favor of the visas. I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/business/trump-immigration-h1b-visa.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/rcna185656) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/12/29/2024/trump-fails-to-clarify-stance-on-highly-sough-h-1b-visas-wanted-by-silicon-valley) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/28/trump-h1b-musk-immigration-debate/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-28/trump-says-he-supports-skilled-worker-visas-ny-post) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-maga-immigration-visas-musk-91ab17e141cc9764fb18b8bc862c84dc) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/28/musk-war-h1b-racists-maga-doge) / [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/12/elon-musk-maga-fight-h1b/681187/))

* **New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu argued that Elon Musk’s wealth negates any potential conflicts of interest** and ensures his motivations in advising Trump are driven by a larger vision for America rather than financial gain. ([Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/12/elon-musk-conflict-interest-chris-sununu-new-hampshire-governor-cnn-dana-bash/))
* **Germany accused Elon Musk of election interference after he endorsed the far-right AfD in a German newspaper op-ed, calling it the "last spark of hope" for the country**. “The traditional parties have failed in Germany,” Musk wrote. “Their policies have led to economic stagnation, social unrest, and the erosion of national identity.” The far-right Alternative for Germany party has been designated by Germany’s domestic intelligence service as a “suspected extremist” organization. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/30/musk-germany-far-right-afd-welt-op-ed/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-musk-far-right-afd-welt-915cc6821cd48c3168a7895b1d1c1a35) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/28/world/europe/musk-support-for-german-far-right-afd.html))
* **Far-right MAGA supporters are showing increased signs of violent and extremist behavior**, driven by Trump’s rhetoric, as they prepare for his potential second presidency. A letter in Oregon urged locals to surveil and report minorities, echoing Nazi-era tactics, while promising material rewards from confiscated property. Trump’s supporters, emboldened by his rhetoric and promises of pardons, have shown increased aggression, including violent incidents and calls for religious and racial homogeneity. Religious and political figures tied to MAGA ideologies have further fueled these sentiments, promoting exclusionary and violent agendas. Analysts worry about the potential for escalating violence as MAGA followers take matters into their own hands.

4/ **Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that "extraordinary measures" will be necessary as early as Jan. 14 to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its debt** unless Congress raises or suspends the debt ceiling. “I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,” Yellen added. The federal debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion.

5/ **The Treasury Department was hacked by a Chinese state-sponsored actor using third-party software to access to government workstations and unclassified documents**. The department called it "a major incident." The "threat actor" was able to override security measures  to remotely access some Treasury workstations and “certain unclassified documents maintained by those users." ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-30/us-treasury-says-it-was-hacked-by-chinese-state-sponsored-actor) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/30/treasury-hack-china-national-security/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-treasury-says-computers-hacked-chinese-threat-actor-rcna185809))

6/ **Trump urged the Supreme Court to block a law that requires TikTok to be sold or shut down by Jan. 19** – the day before his inauguration. The court previously agreed to hear TikTok’s challenge to the potential ban and is set to hear oral arguments on Jan. 10. The bipartisan Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was passed and signed into law in April. It requires TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the social media platform to an American company or face a ban. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-urges-supreme-court-hit-pause-law-ban-tiktok-us-month-rcna185606) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/27/us/politics/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-trump.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5058073-trump-asks-supreme-court-delay-tiktok-ban/))

7/ **Biden announced nearly $2.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine**. The package includes $1.25 billion in Presidential Drawdown Authority, which pulls weapons and ammunition from existing U.S. stockpiles, and the final $1.22 billion from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. Separately, the Treasury Department the U.S. will provide $3.4 billion in economic assistance under last year’s Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.

8/ **Biden privately regrets dropping out of the presidential race and reportedly believes he could’ve defeated Trump** if it wasn’t for his [June debate performance](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/06/28/day-1256/#1-the-first-presidential-debate-betw) and [low poll numbers](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/07/03/day-1261/#poll-74-of-voters-said-biden-is-too) that lead to [his own party pressuring him to drop out](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/07/21/day-1279/#1-following-intense-pressure-from-ne). Biden has also privately said he shouldn’t have picked Merrick Garland as attorney general, because Garland’s Justice Department was slow to prosecute Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection while aggressive in prosecuting his son, Hunter. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/28/bidens-lonely-battle-to-sell-american-democracy/))

9/ **Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the U.S., died on Sunday at age 100** – the oldest living U.S. president of all time. Carter was elected president in 1976 and served one term before losing re-election in 1980 to Ronald Reagan. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/former-president-jimmy-carter-dies-100-rcna42410) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/29/jimmy-carter-death/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/us/politics/jimmy-carter-dead.html))
