1/ **A federal judge ruled that the Justice Department may release the portion of special counsel Jack Smith’s report on Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election**. The release is expected as early as Tuesday. Judge Aileen Cannon, however, maintained a block on sharing the section of the report on Trump’s classified documents case, citing concerns over potential prejudice to Trump’s former co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, whose charges remain pending. Smith’s report concludes his investigations into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and mishandle classified materials, with legal challenges continuing over the release of remaining sections.

2/ **Special counsel Jack Smith resigned from the Department of Justice after completing investigations into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and mishandling classified documents**. Smith’s departure, expected ahead of Trump’s inauguration as the cases were dismissed under longstanding DOJ policy that prohibits prosecuting a sitting president, followed the submission of his final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland, who plans to release the report on election interference but not the classified documents case, citing pending proceedings against Trump’s former co-defendants. Both of Smith’s cases were blocked by court rulings: In July, Judge Aileen Cannon [dismissed the classified documents case](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/07/15/day-1273/#2-judge-aileen-cannon-dismissed-spec), finding that Garland lacked the authority to appoint Smith. Separately, the Supreme Court delayed the election interference case for months while reviewing Trump’s claim of immunity before ultimately issuing a [landmark decision](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/07/01/day-1259/#1-the-supreme-court-ruled-6-3-that-t) that granted  “absolute immunity from criminal prosecution” for “official acts." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/special-counsel-jack-smith-resigns-trump-rcna187280) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/11/jack-smith-resigns-justice-department-trump-criminal-investigation-00197694) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/politics/jack-smith-special-counsel-resigns.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/11/politics/jack-smith-resigns-special-counsel-doj/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/11/jack-smith-trump-special-counsel-resigns/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/11/special-counsel-jack-smith-resign-trump))

3/ **California Governor Gavin Newsom accused Trump of spreading disinformation about the ongoing Los Angeles wildfires**, including false claims about water policies and disaster response. Trump also called Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass “incompetent” and asked why the fires weren’t extinguished yet. Newsom responded, saying the "mis- and disinformation I don’t think advantages or aids any of us," and invited Trump to tour the damage. Trump has not responded. The wildfires have killed at least 24 people, destroyed over 12,000 of structures, and are expected to become the most costly natural disaster in U.S. history. Trump, nevertheless, has suggested he may withhold federal aid from California while House Republicans have discussed attaching conditions to federal disaster aid. With the wildfires expected to be the most costly natural disaster in U.S. history, Newsom urged federal leaders not to politicize the disaster, which could delay recovery and worsen the crisis. Mexico and Canada, meanwhile, have sent firefighting teams, air tankers, and technical support to assist in battling the wildfires. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/newsom-slams-trump-disinformation-california-wildfires-rcna187301) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/12/newsom-wildfires-worst-natural-disaster-california-00197715) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/12/us/trump-los-angeles-fire-newsom-bass.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/11/warren-davidson-republican-disaster-relief-california-wildfires) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/13/house-republicans-trump-wildfire-aid-00197766) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/us/mexico-canada-firefighters-california.html))

4/ **Marjorie Taylor Greene questioned why “they” haven’t used “cloud seeding” to stop the California wildfires, despite the practice being ineffective in dry conditions**. “Why don’t they use geoengineering like cloud seeding to bring rain down on the wildfires in California?” Greene tweeted. “They know how to do it.” Cloud seeding – a practice developed in the 1940s which aims to produce rain or snow by releasing silver iodide particles or salt into clouds to encourage precipitation – only works in areas with existing atmospheric moisture and cannot prevent or extinguish wildfires. The method cannot generate water where none exists, making it ineffective in wildfire-prone areas that have low humidity. In October, [Greene claimed that the government can control the weather](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/10/09/day-1359/#1-with-landfall-by-milton-a-major-ca), saying "they" created Hurricane Milton days after Hurricane Helene killed more than 230 people, including two dozen people in her state. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done,” she said at the time. ([HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-cloud-seeding-california-wildfires_n_67851b40e4b0a67d61a3f70a) / [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-launches-unhinged-call-for-officials-to-manipulate-the-weather-to-stop-la-wildfires/) / [The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-cloud-seeding-california-wildfires-b2678724.html))

5/ **Steve Bannon publicly called Elon Musk a “racist” and “truly evil,”** vowing to block his influence in the Trump administration over disagreements about immigration policy and Musk’s influence. Bannon’s remarks stem from Musk’s support for the H-1B visa program, which Bannon and other MAGA hardliners view as harmful to American workers. Trump, however, has backed Musk’s pro-immigration stance, highlighting a rift within his inner circle. Despite Musk’s significant financial and advisory role in Trump’s campaign, Bannon pledged to Musk "run out of here by Inauguration Day." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/12/bannon-musk-trump-maga/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/13/steve-bannon-elon-musk-trump-maga) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/12/steve-bannon-calls-elon-musk-racist) / [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/steve-bannon-vows-to-oust-elon-musk-from-donald-trump-inner-circle) / [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/01/12/a-truly-evil-guy-bannon-bashes-musk-as-maga-infighting-continues/))

6/ **A coalition of health experts urged the Senate to reject Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services**, warning that his “unfounded, fringe beliefs could significantly undermine public health practices across the country and around the world.” The coalition said Kennedy "has little to no relevant administrative, policy or health experience or expertise that would prepare him to oversee the work of critical public health agencies.” [Last month](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/12/10/day-1421/#3-a-group-of-77-nobel-laureates-urge), a group of 77 Nobel laureates urged the Senate to reject Kennedy’s nomination, calling him “a belligerent critic of respected agencies" who would “put the public’s health in jeopardy and undermine America’s global leadership in the health sciences.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/us/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-public-health-secretary.html))

7/ **The incoming Trump administration has questioned National Security Council staff about their political affiliations, voting history, and social media activity**, raising concerns about loyalty to Trump. These nonpolitical civil servants, typically retained across administrations, are being pressured to leave, aligning with incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz’s goal of staffing the NSC only with Trump-aligned personnel. Critics warn this approach could erode institutional knowledge, hinder effective policymaking, and stifle dissenting views within the council.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Biden announced the forgiveness of student loans for over 150,000 borrowers**, bringing the total debt relief under his administration to more than $183 billion for over 5 million individuals. The new round of forgiveness targets defrauded students, individuals with permanent disabilities, and public servants. While Biden’s broad loan forgiveness plan was blocked by the Supreme Court, his administration expanded and streamlined existing debt relief programs to deliver significant financial relief. As Biden prepares to leave office, the future of such initiatives remains uncertain under the incoming Trump administration. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-13/student-loan-borrowers-aided-by-biden-debt-relief-tops-5-million) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-cancels-student-loan-another-150000-borrowers-rcna187453) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5082368-biden-student-loan-forgiveness-student-debt-relief/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/13/biden-student-loan-debt-forgiven.html))

2. **The Biden administration announced new global export controls to restrict advanced AI chip and technology exports**, aiming to block China’s access while supporting U.S. allies. The rules divide countries into tiers, with arms-embargoed nations like China and Russia facing strict bans, and allies such as Japan and the UK exempt from restrictions. U.S. companies can export under certain conditions, but critics, including Nvidia and Oracle, argue the measures hinder innovation and competitiveness. These regulations mark the culmination of a four-year effort to protect U.S. leadership in AI and will take effect 120 days after publication.

3. **JD Vance said Jan. 6 rioters who protested peacefully should be pardoned, but those who "committed violence" should not**, acknowledging “gray areas” in the cases. Trump has pledged quick pardons for many Jan. 6 defendants while suggesting exceptions for individuals deemed excessively violent. Critics warn that pardoning those convicted of sedition or violence undermines democracy and the rule of law. ([Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/vance-jan-6-protesters-pardons-violence-1235232707/))

4. **House Republicans introduced the “Make Greenland Great Again Act,”** which would authorize Trump to negotiate with Denmark to acquire Greenland. Danish and Greenlandic leaders have pushed back on the idea, though Trump has not ruled out military force to pursue his goals, raising concerns about U.S. relations with its allies. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/13/trump-buy-greenland-house-republican-bill))

5. **JD Vance called Greenland “strategically important” to the U.S. and suggested there could be a diplomatic solution for increased U.S. involvement**, echoing Trump’s desire for control of the island. Greenland’s strategic location and natural resources make it a key focus in the global competition for Arctic dominance, especially as climate change opens new opportunities.

*News analysis and opinions on today’s key headlines – why they matter and what’s at stake.*

1. **Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to dismantle Meta’s third-party fact-checking network follows a growing trend among Silicon Valley figures, including Elon Musk, of undermining public trust in journalism and accountability**. This reflects a broader shift by tech leaders toward right-wing authoritarianism, using their platforms to resist regulation and defund public media. These actions could weaken independent journalism and democratic norms worldwide. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/11/trump-musk-zuckerberg-war-on-facts-truth-pushback-now))

2. **Biden criticized Mark Zuckerberg for ending Meta’s fact-checking program, calling it “shameful” and harmful to truth-telling in America**. He expressed concerns about billionaires using their platforms irresponsibly, highlighting the risks of misinformation spreading unchecked. Biden also addressed economic progress, defended sanctions on Russia, and discussed the implications of Trump’s upcoming presidency, including potential pre-emptive pardons. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/us/politics/biden-meta-fact-checking.html))

3. **Trump, set to become the first U.S. president with a felony conviction, has spent years framing legal cases against him as politically motivated “witch hunts,”** a narrative that resonated with his base and influenced public opinion. Despite his conviction on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records, Trump’s portrayal of himself as a victim of partisan attacks allowed him to shift focus away from legal and ethical concerns. This strategy proved successful in his 2024 campaign, where many voters prioritized economic and policy issues over his legal troubles. His election reflects a shifting perception of the presidency, where accountability is increasingly viewed through partisan lenses, raising questions about democratic norms and leadership expectations. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/us/politics/trump-felon-presidency.html))

4. **Republicans continue pushing restrictive election reforms despite Trump’s 2024 victory, focusing on noncitizen voting, despite evidence it is rare and illegal**. Representative Chip Roy reintroduced the SAVE Act to require proof of citizenship for voter registration, a move critics say could disenfranchise eligible voters, particularly among minorities and Democrats. Activists, led by Cleta Mitchell, are advocating for broad changes such as eliminating early voting and same-day registration, emphasizing “election integrity” while dismissing increased protections for election officials. These efforts are likely to see greater success in Republican-controlled states than at the federal level.
