1/ **Nancy Pelosi will transmit the article of impeachment charging Trump with ‚Äúincitement of insurrection‚Äù to the Senate on Monday**, triggering the start of Trump‚Äôs second impeachment trial. "The Senate will conduct a trial on the impeachment of Donald Trump," Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. "It will be a fair trial. But make no mistake, there will be a trial." Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, suggested that Trump's trial should be delayed to mid-February to give him time to "mount a defense," adding that "this impeachment began with an unprecedentedly fast and minimal process over in the House." Under Senate rules, the impeachment trial must begin within one day after the House transmits the article if the chamber is in session.
