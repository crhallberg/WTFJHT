1/ **Trump pardoned Michael Flynn**, his first national security advisor, who pleaded guilty ‚Äì twice ‚Äì to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts during the presidential transition in late 2016 and early 2017. Trump announced the news on Twitter and wished Flynn "a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!‚Äù The pardon was issued before a judge ruled on a Justice Department motion to dismiss charges and undo Flynn‚Äôs guilty plea to lying to the FBI. Since last year, Flynn‚Äôs lawyers have sought to withdraw his guilty plea. In May, Attorney General William Barr and the Justice Department sought to dismiss its charges, declaring that prosecutors should not have brought the case against Flynn. The request to withdraw charges has been pending before a federal judge, who has been reviewing the case. Flynn's pardon is expected to be part of a series of pardons that Trump issues between now and when he leaves office, [including](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/us/politics/trump-pardons.html) former Trump campaign advisers Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos.

2/ **Biden dismissed pursuing investigations into Trump after he leaves office**, saying "I will not do what this president does and use the Justice Department as my vehicle to insist that something happened." Biden's comments, however, didn't rule out that the Justice Department could still investigate Trump, since it traditionally operates independently of the White House on criminal matters. Biden also acknowledged that states could continue pursue their own investigations.

5/ **Biden's pick for Secretary of State and a top contender for defense secretary co-founded a Washington consulting firm where at least 21 of the 38 employees donated to his campaign**. Because WestExec's staffers aren‚Äôt lobbyists ‚Äì they aren't directly advocating for federal dollars on behalf of clients ‚Äì they don't have to disclose who they worked for. One of WestExec former principals, Avril Haines, is Biden‚Äôs pick for director of national intelligence, and Mich√®le Flournoy, a potential pick for defense secretary, raised more than $100,000 alone for Biden. At least five WestExec employees are helping staff Biden‚Äôs review teams for the Pentagon, the Treasury Department, the Council of Economic Advisers and other agencies, including Jen Psaki, who is advising Biden‚Äôs transition team. Two other former WestExec employees, Lisa Monaco and Julianne Smith, are also considered potential Biden administration hires.
