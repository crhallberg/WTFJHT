1/ **The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack subpoenaed a former Justice Department lawyer who tried to use department resources to push Trump’s false claims of voting fraud in the 2020 election**. Internal emails show that Jeffrey Clark urged top DOJ officials to send out a letter he drafted that falsely claimed the FBI found evidence of voter fraud in multiple states. Richard Donoghue, who served as the acting deputy attorney general at the time, replied: "There is no chance that I would sign this letter or anything remotely like this \[...\] from where I stand, this is not even within the realm of possibility." In early January, Trump [reportedly](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/10/08/day-262/#2-trump-directly-asked-the-justice-d) entertained a plan to fire acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen and replace him with Clark, who would publicly pursue Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud. The committee is seeking documents and a deposition from Clark by Oct. 29. Rosen, meanwhile, sat for an interview with the committee today.

2/ **A federal judge held Washington, D.C.'s corrections director and jail warden in contempt of court**, ruling they had improperly delayed medical treatment for a defendant detained as part of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Judge Royce Lamberth acted after jail officials failed to turn over the information needed to approve surgery for Christopher Worrell, who broke his wrist in May while in custody. Worrell, a member of the Proud Boys, was charged with four felonies, including rioting and spraying pepper gel at police. Prosecutors have alleged that Worrell traveled to Washington and coordinated with Proud Boys leading up to the attack. Lamberth, calling Worrell's delayed treatment “incompetent” and “inexcusable," said he would refer the case to the Justice Department to investigate whether the jail violated the civil rights of other detained Jan. 6 defendants.

3/ **The U.S. will lift travel restrictions at land borders with Canada and Mexico for fully vaccinated travelers**.  Starting in November, nonessential travelers, such as those entering for tourism or to visit family members, will be required to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination to Customs and Border Protection officers when they cross land borders. For the last 19 months, only “essential travel” had been allowed across the Canadian and Mexican borders. In January, essential travelers will also be required to be fully vaccinated. Unvaccinated travelers will continue to be banned from crossing.

4/ **Biden announced that the Port of Los Angeles will operate “24 hours a day, seven days a week" as part of an effort to relieve supply chain bottlenecks**. The announcement follows a similar transition by the Port of Long Beach in September. Together, the ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach account for 40% of all shipping containers entering the U.S. As of Monday, there were 62 ships berthed at the two ports and 81 waiting to dock and unload. The average anchorage time has stretched to more than 11 days, driving prices higher for U.S. consumers. Consumer prices, meanwhile, climbed 5.4% from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

5/ **The House approved a bill to raise the debt ceiling into early December**, postponing the threat of a first-ever national default. The bill, passed by the Senate last week, now heads to Biden’s desk. He is expected to sign it later this week. The legislation extends the debt ceiling by $480 billion, which the Treasury Department has estimated is enough to last until at least Dec. 3 – the same day government funding will expire.

6/ **The Biden administration announced a plan to develop wind farms along nearly the entire U.S. coastline**. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management will hold up to seven lease sales by 2025 in the Gulf of Maine, Gulf of Mexico, and off the coasts of California, the Carolinas, and Oregon as part of Biden's pledge to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030 – enough to power 10 million homes.
