1/ **The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Trump is entitled to "absolute immunity from criminal prosecution" for "official acts," but enjoys "no immunity for unofficial acts."** The decision sends Trump‚Äôs federal election subversion case back to the trial judge to determine which ‚Äì if any ‚Äì of his actions were part of his official duties and thus protected from prosecution. ‚ÄúThe president is not above the law,‚Äù Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court. "But under our system of separated powers, the President may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for his official acts. That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office." Roberts noted that Trump asserted "a far broader immunity than the limited one we have recognized," and ‚Äúnot everything the President does is official.‚Äù Trump faces four felony counts, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and obstruction of an official proceeding, for his attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. The court‚Äôs decision likely ensures that Trump won‚Äôt be tried before the election, and if he is reelected, Trump is expected to order the Justice Department to drop the charges against him ‚Äì or pardon himself. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing Trump's Jan. 6 case, will now determine whether Trump's actions, such as pressuring the Justice Department to investigate unfounded claims of widespread election fraud and urging Pence to refuse to certify the election results during the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, are considered "official." The court‚Äôs three liberal justices [made clear](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/liberal-justices-say-trump-immunity-decision-will-disastrous-consequen-rcna159755) in their [dissent](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/supreme-court-liberals-presidential-immunity.html) that they view the ruling by their conservative colleagues as a threat to democracy that will have ‚Äúdisastrous consequences.‚Äù Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote: "Today‚Äôs decision to grant former Presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the Presidency. It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law \[...\] The damage has been done. The relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law \[...\] When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority‚Äôs reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy‚Äôs Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune." Trump, meanwhile, wrote on his personal social media platform: "BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY."

* **üîé What‚Äôs at stake?** At stake is the very foundation of American democracy: the principle that no one, not even the president, is above the law. This ruling sets a dangerous precedent, allowing future presidents to abuse their power without fear of legal repercussions. If presidential actions are shielded from prosecution, the system of checks and balances that protects against tyranny is weakened. This decision threatens to erode public trust in democratic institutions and could pave the way for more autocratic governance. The integrity of our democracy depends on ensuring that all leaders are held accountable for their actions.

* **ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why should I care?** This ruling affects the accountability of the highest office in the land. If presidents can act with impunity, it undermines the rule of law that protects our freedoms and rights. This decision could embolden future leaders to misuse their power, knowing they might escape prosecution. Moreover, it directly impacts the upcoming presidential election, potentially allowing Trump to avoid trial and dominate the political landscape unchallenged. Your voice and vote in this democracy are at risk if the rule of law is compromised. Ensuring accountability for all, regardless of position, is crucial for a fair and just society.

* **Supreme Court Gives Trump Permission to Stand Above Law**. "Chief Justice John Roberts took two crucial steps toward paralyzing any federal prosecution of former presidents for criminal misconduct. First, he extended the concept of presidential immunity for official acts against civil liability, which the Court developed in a 1982 decision involving a lawsuit against former president Richard Nixon. Today‚Äôs decision applies that doctrine to criminal cases, a highly controversial proposition with no real precedent. Second, he set out a test for determining the line between 'official' and 'unofficial' acts that makes it difficult to discern any acts that are not at least presumptively immune."

2/ **The Supreme Court declined to rule on Republican-backed laws in Florida and Texas that regulate the content moderation practices of social media companies**. Instead, the justices unanimously agreed to return the cases to lower courts, saying the courts had failed to properly assess the First Amendment issues central to the dispute. Both laws seek to prevent social media companies from removing certain kinds of political speech, a response to allegations that the companies were illegally censoring conservative "viewpoints," like when Facebook, Twitter, and others banned Trump‚Äôs accounts after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Research, however, has suggested claims of an anti-conservative bias on social media is unfounded.

3/ **Steve Bannon reported to prison to begin a four-month sentence for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena** after the Supreme Court rejected his request to postpone his sentence while he appeals his conviction. Bannon was found guilty of two counts of contempt of Congress in July 2022 after he defied a subpoena for testimony and documents from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Outside the correctional facility, Bannon said he was ‚Äúproud‚Äù to go to prison.

Despite the Justice Department previously making the full transcript available, the House Judiciary Committee nevertheless sued, asking the courts to enforce their subpoena and reject Biden‚Äôs claim of executive privilege.
