1/ **Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg asked to postpone Trump's criminal sentencing in his hush money case**. In a letter to Judge Juan Merchan, the district attorney’s office acknowledged that Trump is not likely to be sentenced “until after the end of Defendant’s upcoming presidential term,” but prosecutors said they oppose any effort to dismiss Trump’s felony conviction. Prosecutors faced a Tuesday deadline to advise Merchan on how to proceed after the "unprecedented circumstances" of Trump's re-election following his conviction on 34 felony counts of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records. Trump faces as many as four years in prison. Prosecutors instead asked for a Dec. 9 deadline for the next filing, focused on whether the case should be dismissed.

* **Georgia court halts arguments in Trump election case as legal challenges shift post-election win**. The Georgia Court of Appeals has indefinitely canceled oral arguments regarding efforts by Trump and co-defendants to remove Fulton County DA Fani Willis from the state election interference case against them. This development follows Trump's presidential election victory, which has led to delays or dismissals in multiple federal and state criminal cases against him, including charges tied to overturning the 2020 election and retaining classified documents. The Department of Justice is expected to dismiss two federal cases against Trump, as legal processes adjust to his incoming presidency.

2/ **An unidentified hacker gained access to files containing containing unredacted sworn testimony from a woman who said Matt Gaetz paid her for sex when she was 17**. The file contains 24 exhibits of sworn statements, including the corroborating testimony by a second woman who said that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with the minor at a drug-fueled party in July 2017. The material has not been made public, yet.

3/ **Trump will nominate celebrity TV doctor Mehmet Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services**. “America is facing a Healthcare Crisis, and there may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again,” Trump said. “Dr. Oz will work closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.” As the administrator for CMS, Oz would report to Kennedy and be responsible for shaping the health coverage for more than 160 million Americans enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and plans obtained through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. In 2020, Oz promoted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 despite the lack of scientific evidence that it was an effective treatment. The FDA also revoked emergency use of the drug, citing “known and potential risks.” The position requires Senate confirmation.

4/ **Republican Nancy Mace introduced a resolution to ban transgender women from using women’s bathrooms at the Capitol after Sarah McBride became the first transgender woman to be elected to Congress**. Mace’s resolution would amend House rules to block McBride and any other trans person visiting the Capitol from using bathrooms associated with their gender identity. And while the resolution doesn’t specifically name McBride, Mace said that “it’s 100 percent because of McBride” and that "McBride doesn’t get a say.” Speaker Mike Johnson told Republican lawmakers that the House will welcome “all new members with open arms,” “accommodate the needs of every single person,” and "treat all persons with dignity and respect." Later, however, Johnson clarified his view that "a man is a man, and a woman is a woman, and a man cannot become a woman." McBride called the resolution "a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing,” McBride said. “We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.” Marjorie Taylor Greene, [meanwhile](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/19/congress/mtg-threatens-to-fight-transgender-woman-00190344), threatened to fight any "biological men" who try to use the woman’s bathroom.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **House Democrats voted unanimously to reelect House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries**. Alongside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Jeffries will focus on countering Republican policies and defending democratic principles in a politically divided government. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/19/hakeem-jeffries-reelected-house-democrat-leader))

2. **Ukraine fired at least six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles at a weapons depot in Russia**. The Russian Defense Ministry said air defenses shot down five ATACMS missiles, but fragments of another “fell on the technical territory of a military facility in the Bryansk region, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. There were no casualties or damage.” Putin, meanwhile, approved an updated nuclear doctrine that now says Russia can launch a nuclear attack against a country assisting a non-nuclear country in aggression against Russia – a reference to NATO.

3. **Texas board advances Bible-based curriculum for public schools despite controversy over religion's role in education**. The Texas State Board of Education has preliminarily approved an optional K-5 curriculum incorporating Bible-based lessons into reading and language arts, sparking debates about religion in public education. Advocates argue the curriculum enriches cultural and historical literacy, while critics say it risks violating the First Amendment and lacks balance, disproportionately favoring Christianity. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/us/texas-bible-curriculum-public-schools.html))

4. **Far-right militia "Veterans on Patrol" escalates anti-government threats over baseless claims of hurricane manipulation**. A far-right militia group is promoting baseless conspiracy theories claiming Hurricane Helene was caused by U.S. military weather manipulation to advance a government agenda, such as land seizures and "smart city" projects. The group’s online chats reveal plans to target military equipment they allege is used for weather control, escalating anti-government rhetoric and raising fears of violence, particularly with Trump’s re-election. The militia has a history of spreading conspiracy theories, anti-government sentiment, and engaging in unlawful activities under the leadership of Michael "Lewis Arthur" Meyer.

*News analysis and opinions on today’s key headlines – why they matter and what’s at stake.*

1. **Trump escalates attacks on Iowa pollster in continued assault on critics and institutions, fueling fears of state weaponization**. Trump has targeted Ann Selzer, a prominent pollster, accusing her of "election fraud" after a poll inaccurately predicted Harris leading in Iowa. Despite Selzer announcing her exit from polling, Trump’s calls for investigations into her work highlight a troubling pattern of retaliatory behavior against critics. Scholars warn that such actions signal authoritarian governance, weaponizing state resources against perceived adversaries. ([New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/188545/donald-trump-dictator-tantrum-selzer-poll))

2. **Trump's transition sparks turbulence with extreme government cuts, controversial appointments, and sweeping policy reversals**. The Biden administration secured significant advancements, such as a $65 billion semiconductor investment and clean energy initiatives, but Trump's incoming administration plans dramatic changes. These include deep government cuts inspired by Argentina’s economic “shock therapy,” rescinding climate action, and reversing worker protections. Trump's proposed controversial appointees and mass deportation plans raise legal and financial concerns, while his claim of a mandate is contradicted by electoral realities and narrow Republican control. Economic shifts, including falling gas prices, highlight stark contrasts in governance priorities. ([Heather Cox Richardson](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/november-18-2024))

3. **Trump’s AI policies prioritize speed over safety**. Trump’s expected AI policies emphasize minimal regulation, aligning with accelerationist movements advocating rapid technological advancement. His administration is likely to roll back Biden-era AI safety measures and prioritize competitiveness with China, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing. However, concerns over AI risks, including bias, misuse, and existential threats, persist among both Republicans and safety advocates. Key figures, including Elon Musk and Ivanka Trump, may influence the administration’s nuanced stance as the AI era unfolds.
