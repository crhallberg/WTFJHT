todayInOneSentence: Trump "stands alone in American history" for his efforts to overturn
  his loss in the 2020 presidential election; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested
  that Israel will have ‚Äúoverall security responsibility‚Äù in Gaza ‚Äúfor an indefinite
  period‚Äù after its war with Hamas despite a warning from the White House that a "reoccupation
  of Gaza by Israeli forces is not good"; with 10 days left before a potential government
  shutdown and no strategy to keep the government funded, Speaker Mike Johnson suggested
  that the public ‚Äútrust us‚Äù; and it's Election Day in America where voters in several
  states will participate in an off-year general election that will determine the
  next governor in two states, control of the state's legislature in another, and
  whether to enshrine abortion rights into one state's constitution.

1/ **Trump "stands alone in American history" for his efforts to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election**, special counsel Jack Smith‚Äôs office said in a court filing. In a 79-page court filing, prosecutors asked a judge to reject Trump's "meritless effort" to dismiss their four-count indictment, saying ‚Äúno other president has engaged in conspiracy and obstruction to overturn valid election results and illegitimately retain power.‚Äù Prosecutors said they plan to show that Trump repeatedly lied about the results of the 2020 election as part of a conspiracy to subvert the legitimate results, and that he is now attempting to "rewrite the indictment" and ‚Äúsanitize‚Äù his conduct by making claims that are full of ‚Äúdistortions and misrepresentations.‚Äù In total, Trump has made four attempts to dismiss the federal indictment charging him with attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which culminated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by his supporters.

2/ **Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that Israel will have ‚Äúoverall security responsibility‚Äù in Gaza ‚Äúfor an indefinite period‚Äù after its war with Hamas** despite a warning from the White House that a "reoccupation of Gaza by Israeli forces is not good." In a call with Netanyahu, Biden urged Israel to agree to a three-day "humanitarian" pause in the fighting to allow for the release of 10-15 hostages and for aid to enter Gaza. An Israeli official likened a three-day pause to a cease-fire, saying Netanyahu doesn't believe such a large window of time is needed to release such a small number of hostages. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant added: "We can‚Äôt cease this war until its goals are complete \[...\] can‚Äôt stop \[...\] until winning over Hamas and the return of hostages." Israel‚Äôs military, meanwhile, has "encircled" Gaza City and is now "operating" in its "depths," a move that U.S. officials warned would lead to increased casualties. In the month since the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack, at least 10,300 Palestinians, including more than 4,200 children, have been killed, and more than 25,900 have been wounded, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. The World Health Organization said the death toll was "hard to fathom." More than 1.5 million people ‚Äì about 70% of the population ‚Äì in the Gaza Strip has been displaced. At least 1,400 people were killed in Israel on Oct. 7, and at least 5,400 people have been injured, according to Israeli officials.

3/ **With 10 days left before a potential government shutdown and no strategy to keep the government funded, Speaker Mike Johnson suggested that the public ‚Äútrust us.‚Äù** After House Republicans failed to find consensus on a spending plan during a closed-door meeting, which one member described as a ‚Äútrain wreck,‚Äù Johnson said he'd reveal the GOP‚Äôs funding plan ‚Äúin short order,‚Äù but that he's not going to ‚Äúshow you all the cards right now.‚Äù Johnson added: ‚ÄúTrust us: We‚Äôre working through the process in a way that I think that people will be proud of.‚Äù House Republicans are debating three possible approaches: the first is a "clean" continuing resolution, which would keep the government funded through mid-January; the second is a laddered spending plan that would fund different parts of the government incrementally ‚Äì an approach that Senate Republicans have already panned; and the third option is to wait and see what the Democratic-led Senate sends them. The government must be funded by Nov. 17.
