Shortly after, Nevada was also called for Biden. ‚ÄúWith the campaign over, it‚Äôs time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation,‚Äù Biden said in the statement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for America to unite. And to heal. We are the United States of America. And there‚Äôs nothing we can‚Äôt do, if we do it together.‚Äù Shortly before news organization called the race, Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1325099845045071873) "I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!" Kamala Harris will become the nation‚Äôs first woman, first Asian American, and first Black vice president. Trump, meanwhile, is the first president since 1992 to fail to win a second term. Biden is expected to give his victory speech at 8 p.m. Saturday ‚Äî a full five days after the last ballots were cast.
