1/ **The Senate advanced a bill to repeal the congressional authorization used to attack Iraq in 1991 and 2003** – nearly 20 years to the day that the U.S. began its "shock and awe" campaign to topple Saddam Hussein's regime. The bipartisan legislation would repeal the 2002 authorization for the use of military force that Bush used for the 2003 invasion, as well as the 1991 authorization for the first Gulf War under H.W. Bush. Although Obama formally ended the war in 2011 and ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops, Trump used the 2002 authorization to justify the [airstrike](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/01/05/day-1081/#1-trump-authorized-a-drone-strike-at) that killed Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020. It's unclear, however, if Kevin McCarthy will bring the legislation up for a vote in the House. "Repealing this \[Authorization for Use of Military Force\] is a necessary step towards putting the final remnants of the Iraq War squarely behind us," Chuck Schumer said.

2/ **The Pentagon will accelerate the training and delivery of Abrams tanks and Patriot missile defense systems for Ukraine**. The U.S. will send 31 older M1-A1 models instead of the more modern version of the tank in order to get them to Ukraine this fall. A group of 65 Ukrainian soldiers, meanwhile, are scheduled to complete their training on the Patriot missile system in the coming days. Two Patriot systems are expected to be deployed to Ukraine in the coming of weeks.

3/ **The Minnesota House of Representatives advanced legislation that would shield patients who travel to the state for an abortion and the providers that treat them**. If passed by the Senate and signed into law, the Reproductive Freedom Defense Act would prevent state courts or officials from complying with extraditions, arrests or subpoenas related to reproductive health care that a person receives in Minnesota. The bill now goes to the state Senate, where Democrats hold a thin majority. ([Minnesota Public Radio](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/03/20/minnesota-house-passes-bill-that-shields-abortion-providers-outofstate-patients) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-rights-bill-minnesota-e22e5375c46d4bc2c6ca5f804137b1b5) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/03/21/minnesota-abortion-bill/))

4/ **Missouri’s Republican attorney general filed an emergency regulation to limit access to gender-affirming treatments for minors**. Andrew Bailey's new rules will require an 18-month waiting period, 15 hourlong therapy sessions, and treatment of any mental illnesses before Missouri doctors can provide that kind of care to transgender children, Bailey’s office said. The Missouri Senate, meanwhile, advanced a pair of bills to prohibit gender-affirming health care for minors and restrict them from competing in sports. Both bills, which sunset in 2027, need a final vote from the Senate before heading to the House.

5/ **Biden designated new national monuments in Nevada and Texas**. The designation of the Avi Kwa Ame monument in Nevada, and Castner Range monument in West Texas protects nearly 514,000 acres of land from new development. Biden also started the process to designate a new marine sanctuary in U.S. waters around the Pacific islands southwest of Hawaii, which will protect 777,000 square miles of islands, reefs, and marine life. After taking office, Biden [committed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/22/report-details-how-biden-can-protect-30-percent-us-lands-waters-by-2030-without-congress/) to conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030.

6/ **A Fox News producer filed a lawsuit claiming the network's lawyers coerced her into providing misleading testimony in Dominion Voting Systems’ $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the network**. The lawsuit from Abby Grossberg came shortly after Fox News sought a temporary restraining order to prevent her from disclosing privileged information, like in-house legal discussions. In a federal civil suit, Grossberg alleges that Fox News lawyers “coerced, intimidated, and misinformed” her as they prepared her to testify in Dominion’s $1.6 billion defamation suit. Grossberg also contends that Fox News lawyers advised her against hiring a personal attorney and implied that she was being “too candid” in her deposition prep sessions. Grossberg claims the attorneys took extra time “to make sure she got her story straight and in line with \[Fox’s\] position” and that was urged to give generic answers, like “I do not recall.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/fox-news-dominion-defamation-lawsuit-voting-sexism-9f0b4ec94a19fa68c1205864fef277c5) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fox-news-producer-alleges-network-coerced-testimony-dominion-case-rcna75871) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/03/20/fox-news-abby-grossberg-gag-order-dominion/))

7/ **U.S. cases of a rare and often deadly fungus tripled from 2019 to 2021**. More than half of U.S. states have now reported the fungus, Candida auris, which is resistant to several antifungal medications. Candida auris has a mortality rate of up to 60%. The CDC and World Health Organization have labeled it a growing threat to public health. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/candida-auris-fungus-superbug-bd20721b4233afd5e3c41432db54ea5f) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/21/1164912425/candida-auris-yeast-fungus-cdc-spread) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/deadly-fungus-detected-in-most-u-s-states-1eb3453a?mod=hp_listc_pos1))
