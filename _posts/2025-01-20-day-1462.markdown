1/ **Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States after defeating Kamala Harris in the 2024 election**, winning 49.9% of the popular vote with a margin of 1.48 percentage point – one of the narrowest popular vote margins in modern U.S. history. Trump called his inauguration, which fell on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, “Liberation Day,” saying his victory would be remembered as “the most consequential election” in U.S. history. In his second inaugural address – eight years after he depicted a bleak vision of the country he described as plagued by “American carnage” – Trump declared that “America’s decline is over” and promised that “the golden age of America begins right now.” Trump called his election a “mandate to completely reverse a horrible betrayal" and vowed that the nation's challenges would be "annihilated" in a “thrilling new era of national success.” Trump [outlined a platform](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/20/donald-trump-inauguration-day-news-updates-analysis/day-one-rundown-congress-00199332) focused on border security, energy independence, government reform, and promoting traditional American values as part of his policy agenda. Trump pledged to reinstate strict border policies, deploy the military for border enforcement, and designate cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. His energy plans include rolling back regulations, withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord, and prioritizing domestic energy production. He promised to overhaul federal bureaucracy, reduce remote work, and eliminate policies he described as radical or burdensome. Trump also committed to defending traditional gender roles and revisiting the naming of American landmarks. Trump announced plans to rename the Gulf of Mexico as “the Gulf of America” and to revert Denali, North America’s highest peak, to its former name, Mount McKinley. He also pledged to seize control of the Panama Canal, declaring, “We’re taking it back,” and vowed to “pursue our Manifest Destiny into the stars” while talking about planting an American flag on Mars. At 78, Trump is the oldest president ever inaugurated, surpassing Biden’s record by five months. His return to power follows his 2020 election loss, two impeachments, four indictments, one conviction, and a civil ruling finding him liable for sexual abuse. Trump enters office with a unified Republican government, giving him fewer institutional constraints as he advances his populist agenda. The inauguration was moved inside the Capitol Rotunda – the same building where a mob of Trump’s supporters four years earlier violently tried to overturn his election loss to Biden – for the first time in 40 years due to the freezing weather in Washington, D.C. After Trump declared that his life was "saved by God to make America great again,” country music singer Carrie Underwood’s performance of “America, the Beautiful” was interrupted by a technical malfunction, leading to a long delay before she was forced to sing the song a cappella. Earlier in the day, Biden hosted Trump and Melania for coffee at the White House before as part of an Inauguration Day tradition. As the Trumps got out of their car, Biden greeted them with, “Welcome home.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-to-call-for-revolution-of-common-sense-in-inaugural-address-a6d94c59) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-division-vengeance-inauguration) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-inauguration-swearing-capitol-b3549ebe5dae74a872502aa79def7a11) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/20/trump-inauguration-speech-004932) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-43759/trump-inaugural-address-key-moments) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-takes-power-in-washington-vowing-americas-decline-is-over/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-heralds-golden-age-promise-filled-inaugural-address-rcna186498) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-20/trump-sworn-in-as-47th-president-with-agenda-already-in-motion) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/20/trump-inauguration-live-updates/) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/20/2025/donald-trump-set-to-kick-off-presidency))

2/ **Trump reportedly plans to pardon nearly all Jan. 6 defendants and commute sentences for those convicted of serious crimes**. According to individuals briefed on the plans, Trump intends to grant blanket clemency to over 1,500 people charged in the Capitol riot, including those convicted of seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers. This would also include dismissing about 300 pending cases, some involving violent offenses. Over 1,580 individuals were charged, with approximately 1,270 convictions secured, many of which were for misdemeanors. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/20/trump-pardons-jan-6-defendants/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/politics/january-6-2021-capitol-riot-pardons-trump/index.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/live-blog/trump-inauguration-2025-live-updates-rcna184510#rcrd69700))

3/ **Trump plans to declared a national energy emergency, revoke clean energy policies, and withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement – again**. In his inaugural address, Trump announced plans to boost oil and gas extraction, open federal lands like Alaska for drilling, and reverse Biden-era clean energy initiatives, including fuel economy standards and renewable energy leases. Trump criticized Biden’s use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, vowing to refill it “right to the top” and cut energy prices by prioritizing fossil fuel development. The energy emergency declaration, which aims to increase U.S. energy dominance, includes measures to expand liquefied natural gas exports and unlock domestic critical minerals for technology production. Trump’s decision to remove the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C, requires a formal withdrawal letter to the United Nations. It takes one year to finalize. Hours after Biden was sworn in as the 46th president in 2021 he signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, reversing [Trump’s 2017 decision to withdraw from treaty](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/05/31/Day-132/#1-trump-will-withdraw-from-the-paris). ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html?smid=url-share) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/20/trump-to-declare-national-energy-emergency-expanding-his-legal-options-to-address-high-costs.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/20/donald-trump-inauguration-day-news-updates-analysis/trump-national-energy-emergency-biden-rules-00199265) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-20/trump-says-he-ll-fill-us-strategic-petroleum-reserve-right-to-the-top) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-declare-national-energy-emergency-open-resource-extraction-rcna188382) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/20/trump-withdraws-paris-climate-agreement-00199385))

4/ **Trump will sign executive orders to end birthright citizenship, declare a national emergency at the southern border, and reinstate his "Remain in Mexico" policy**. The Trump administration plans to reinterpret the 14th Amendment to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants – a move expected to face legal challenges. After Trump’s inauguration, the administration canceled all appointments scheduled through the CBP One app, a legal pathway for migrants to enter the U.S., stranding families who had waited months. Additional Trump measures include resuming border wall construction, deploying U.S. troops to the border, designating cartels as terrorist organizations, and expanding deportation efforts nationwide. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/20/trump-immigration-executive-orders/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/politics/trump-executive-actions-immigration/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/20/trump-border-cbp-one-migrants/))

5/ **Trump is expected to sign executive orders recognizing only two biological sexes and ending diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in federal agencies**. One order directs federal agencies to replace “gender” with “sex” on official documents like passports while restricting transgender individuals' rights to “privacy in intimate spaces” in facilities such as prisons, migrant shelters, and rape shelters. The second order eliminates DEI initiatives across federal agencies, including environmental justice programs and equity-related grants. White House officials framed these actions as part of a “restoring sanity” agenda, with Trump calling it a return to “merit-based” and “color-blind” policies. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/trump-sign-executive-orders-proclaiming-are-only-two-biological-sexes-rcna188388) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/20/donald-trump-inauguration-day-news-updates-analysis/trump-removes-nonbinary-gender-00199264))

6/ **Trump launched a cryptocurrency memecoin, $Trump, days before his inauguration**. The token, classified as a memecoin — a type of cryptocurrency with no intrinsic real-world value — reached a market capitalization of over $5 billion within 24 hours of its release. Trump-affiliated entities, however, own 80% of the token’s supply. The coin’s release comes as Trump is preparing to lead a pro-crypto administration that is expected to enact policies benefiting the digital assets industry, including deregulation and shielding crypto firms from enforcement actions. Critics condemned the timing and implications of the launch, calling it as a blatant effort to profit from the presidency and blur the lines between public office and private business interests. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/18/trump-crypto-meme-coin-inauguration-00199157) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-19/trump-s-memecoin-creates-billions-from-thin-air-before-dc-return) / [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346505/donald-trump-launched-meme-coin-crypto-national-priority) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/us/politics/trump-meme-coin-crypto.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/18/trump-meme-coin-25-billion))

poll/ **55% of Americans support deporting all undocumented immigrants**, with 87% favoring deportation for those with criminal records. 71% oppose puberty blockers and hormones for minors struggling with gender identity, and 60% prefer prioritizing domestic issues over international engagement. 73% of respondents oppose Trump investigating or prosecuting his political opponents, and his overall favorability remains below 50%.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **A temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began Sunday**, with three Israeli hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners exchanged in the first phase of the agreement. The six-week truce, brokered by the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt, aims to gradually release 33 Israeli hostages and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners while delivering much-needed humanitarian aid to Gaza. Displaced Palestinians returned to devastated homes, where over 90% have been destroyed. Prime Minister Netanyahu faces internal political pressure to resume the war, while Hamas claims the ceasefire as a victory. The United Nations described the first day of the truce as "good," with hundreds of aid trucks entering Gaza. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/middle-east-live-updates-red-cross-details-complex/?id=117876972) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-ceasefire-live-updates-rcna188355) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-19/first-three-israeli-hostages-released-in-gaza-under-ceasefire) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/19/2025/israel-hamas-ceasefire-fragile-gaza-truce-begins) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/18/biden-trump-witkoff-ceasefire-israel-gaza/))

2. **TikTok began restoring service in the U.S. after Trump announced plans to issue an executive order delaying the app's federal ban** and providing service providers with assurances they would not face penalties. The federal ban, enacted under a 2024 law requiring TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations, took effect Sunday, temporarily shutting down the platform. Trump, however, said his administration would work on a joint ownership plan to address national security concerns, though critics questioned the legality of delaying the enforcement of a bipartisan law upheld by the Supreme Court. ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/technology/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/19/tiktok-trump-executive-order-ban/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/19/trump-tiktok-ban-delay-executive-order) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tiktok-says-restoring-service-us-users-rcna188320))

3. **Vivek Ramaswamy is leaving the Trump administration's "Department of Government Efficiency" to run for governor of Ohio**, leaving Elon Musk to lead the [initiative aimed at cutting federal spending](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/wtf-is/doge/). Ramaswamy's departure follows internal tensions and criticism of his limited participation in DOGE’s efforts. DOGE, meanwhile, already faces a lawsuit challenging its legal status under federal transparency rules.

4. **Trump forced dozens of career diplomats to resign**, clearing the way for loyalists to reshape U.S. diplomacy. Critics warn this could destabilize foreign policy and deepen the politicization of federal agencies. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/19/trump-state-department-resignations/))

5. **Trump plans to revoke the security clearances of 51 former intelligence officials on his first day in office**, targeting those who criticized him in 2020 over Hunter Biden’s laptop. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/20/trump-revoke-security-clearances-intelligence-officials))

6. **Biden issued preemptive pardons for members of his own family, Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley, members of the Jan. 6 committee, and others, hours before Trump’s inauguration**. Biden said the pardons were not an acknowledgment of wrongdoing but a safeguard against retribution from Trump, who has vowed to target his political adversaries. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/politics/joe-biden-preemptive-pardons/index.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-fauci-milley-pardons-january-6-3cba287f89051513fb48d7ae700ae747) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/biden-pardons-fauci-milley-cheney-jan-6.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/20/biden-issues-preemptive-pardons/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/20/biden-pardons-fauci-milley-j6-committee.html))

7. **Biden commuted the sentences of nearly 2,500 nonviolent drug offenders**, marking the largest single commutation of individual sentences by a U.S. president. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/biden-commutes-2500-nonviolent-drug-offenders-83174cd0602a0bf5d491aa60184f3568) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/biden-commute-sentences-drug-offenders.html))

8. **Biden declared that the Equal Rights Amendment should be considered the 28th Amendment to the Constitution**, affirming his belief that it has met all ratification requirements despite expired deadlines. Biden's statement is symbolic and doesn’t compel the National Archives to certify the ERA, which has been blocked by legal disputes over missed deadlines. The ERA, first proposed in 1923, has been debated for decades and is unlikely to advance under the incoming Trump administration or the Republican-controlled Congress. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-equal-rights-amendment-era-16b554dfe913797a52f894b72684bc45) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/17/nx-s1-5264378/biden-era-national-archivist-constitution) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/17/biden-era-amendment-004495) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/biden-equal-rights-amendment-constitution-2b990992) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/17/biden-reaffirms-belief-that-equal-rights-amendment-is-law/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-renews-calls-equal-rights-amendment-ratified-taking/story?id=117789020))

9. **Cecile Richards, the former president of Planned Parenthood and prominent advocate for abortion rights, died at age 67 from brain cancer**, her family announced. Richards led Planned Parenthood from 2006 to 2018. In November 2024, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her lifelong contributions to women’s rights.

### 👑 Portrait of a president.

1. **Biden ended his five decades in public office with a mixed legacy, marked by significant legislative achievements, internal party tensions, and personal controversies, as he hands power over to Trump**. Biden, now 82, leaves office amidst criticism from Democrats who blame his decision to run for re-election and his subsequent withdrawal for the party's defeat in 2024. His term saw major policy successes, such as economic investments and foreign policy efforts, but he struggled with low approval ratings and fractured relationships within his own party. Biden’s pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, and doubts about his cognitive state further fueled criticism. Despite accomplishments like uniting allies on Ukraine and facilitating a ceasefire in Gaza, Biden departs feeling under-appreciated. Veteran strategist James Carville called his exit “one of the great tragedies of American politics,” saying Biden “stayed too long.” ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/joe-biden-ends-5-decades-public-life-one-greatest-tragedies-american-p-rcna183989))

2. **Biden’s presidency achieved significant legislative and foreign policy victories but failed to preserve democracy**, as his decision to seek reelection ultimately paved the way for Trump’s return. Biden’s administration included successes like managing the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, strengthening the economy, supporting Ukraine, and weakening China’s influence. However, his decision to run for reelection, despite concerns over his age and political viability, overshadowed these accomplishments. Democrats delayed addressing his fitness for a second term, culminating in a disastrous debate performance and a chaotic withdrawal from the race that left his party unprepared to challenge Trump. While Biden’s age did not appear to compromise his decision-making, his diminished energy eroded public confidence, and his failure to heed warnings contributed to the very democratic backslide he vowed to prevent. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/01/how-biden-destroyed-his-legacy/681342/))

3. **Biden’s single term in office is likely to be overshadowed by Trump’s return to the White House**. Biden’s presidency began with bold aspirations to restore normalcy, rebuild democracy, and lead on the global stage but faltered due to challenges like inflation, a chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, and limited progress on institutional reforms. His domestic accomplishments, such as major spending bills and climate provisions, and his international leadership in Ukraine and Israel are now vulnerable to reversals under Trump. Biden’s inability to secure a second term dims his legacy, positioning him as a transitional figure rather than a transformational one. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/18/biden-lost-white-house-legacy-00198231))

4. **Analysts Michael Podhorzer and Eric Levitz offered contrasting explanations for Democrats’ 2024 election loss**, with Podhorzer blaming low anti-Trump voter turnout and Levitz arguing that Democrats failed to address key issues like inflation, crime, and immigration. Podhorzer contended that Trump’s 2024 victory was not a result of increased support for MAGA but rather a collapse in turnout among Democratic voters, particularly in urban areas, as anti-Trump voters grew less alarmed about his return. He emphasized that America didn’t “swing rightward” but instead saw disillusioned voters disengage, urging Democrats to focus on mobilizing progressive, anti-MAGA voters rather than moving right. In contrast, Levitz argued that Democrats’ loss stemmed from their failure to win arguments on key issues, as voters became more conservative on topics like crime, immigration, and economic management. Levitz highlighted Republicans’ gains among young and first-time voters, cautioning that Democrats must broaden their coalition to win future elections. Both analysts agreed on the critical importance of diagnosing Democrats’ challenges accurately to avoid further setbacks.

5. **Trump narrowly won the 2024 popular vote by 1.5 points, yet the cultural momentum around his victory has felt far greater than the slim margin suggests**. Ezra Klein argues that Republicans have harnessed social media, corporate frustration with progressive culture, and a backlash against "wokeness" to dominate cultural narratives despite mixed electoral results, such as narrow House and Senate dynamics. Trump’s alignment with tech influencers like Elon Musk and cultural figures has amplified his appeal, particularly among men and Silicon Valley insiders. However, Klein warns that interpreting a close election as a sweeping mandate could lead to overreach and eventual backlash against this more culturally confident version of Trumpism. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/19/opinion/trump-mandate-zuckerberg-masculinity.html))

6. **Senator Chuck Schumer convinced Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race after a blunt meeting, citing his low chances of winning and potential harm to his legacy and the Democratic Party**. In a private meeting at Biden’s Delaware home in July 2024, Schumer told Biden “If I were you, I wouldn’t run, and I’m urging you not to run.” Schumer warned Biden that he risked going down in history as one of the "darkest figures" if he lost to Trump and cost Democrats control of Congress. Schumer, who had avoided addressing Biden’s age and political struggles publicly for months, laid out the overwhelming opposition among Senate Democrats, citing internal polling showing Biden had just a 5% chance of victory. Biden, visibly shaken but not argumentative, asked for a week to decide. The intervention followed months of mounting pressure from Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Obama, who privately agreed that Biden’s candidacy was no longer viable after his disastrous June debate performance against Trump. Ultimately, Biden conceded, ending his campaign. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/schumer-biden-2024-election.html))

7. **Nancy Pelosi’s intervention to push Biden out of the 2024 presidential race fractured their decades-long relationship, with Biden and First Lady Jill Biden refusing to reconcile in his final days in office**. Pelosi’s family expressed frustration with Jill Biden’s public criticism of the former speaker, calling it vindictive, especially after Pelosi’s fall in Luxembourg when Biden failed to offer immediate support. The rupture stemmed from Pelosi’s behind-the-scenes efforts to convince Biden to withdraw after his disastrous debate performance, which she argued jeopardized the Democratic Party’s future. While Pelosi framed her actions as respectful and necessary, Biden saw them as a betrayal, leading to a lasting grudge that allies say he is unlikely to let go. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/19/lady-mcbiden-alexandra-pelosi-first-lady-00199164))

8. **Six close advisers to Biden worked to obscure his declining physical and cognitive state throughout his presidency**, shielding him from scrutiny and manipulating his schedule to maintain public confidence. This inner circle, including family members and senior staff, adjusted his workload, withheld information, and ensured limited media exposure to control the narrative. Their efforts allowed Biden to carry out key legislative achievements but ultimately failed to prevent concerns about his age and fitness from dominating his presidency. Biden’s frailty came into sharp focus after a poor debate performance in 2024 led to the collapse of his reelection bid, leaving his legacy and accomplishments vulnerable to reversal under Trump’s returning administration. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/biden-age.html))

9. **Trump’s return to power has triggered widespread fear among critics, prosecutors, and officials, as he vows to punish those who opposed him**. Trump has pledged to investigate his perceived enemies, including those involved in his prosecutions and the Jan. 6 investigation, raising concerns about abuse of power and political retribution. His promise to pardon Jan. 6 rioters and his appointment of loyalists like Kash Patel to lead the FBI have heightened fears of systemic retaliation and the erosion of democratic norms.
