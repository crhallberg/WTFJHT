1/ **Trump refused to take responsibility for inciting the deadly riot at the Capitol, offered no regrets, and defended his pre-riot speech as "totally appropriate."** In his first public remarks since the violence last week that left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer, Trump deflected blame and called the effort by House Democrats to impeach him for a second time a “witch hunt” that was "causing tremendous anger." The attack on the Capitol came after Trump encouraged a crowd of supporters to march to the building and "fight like hell," saying: "You'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong." Trump also took aim at social media sites that have banned him, saying they had made a “catastrophic mistake” and acted in a “divisive” manner. Trump then left Washington to travel to Alamo, Tex., to tour a section of his border wall.

2/ **Mitch McConnell indicated that he believes Trump committed impeachable offenses** and that he is reportedly "pleased" that Democrats are moving to impeach him. McConnell, who blames Trump for Republicans losing the Senate, believes impeaching Trump a second time would make it easier to "purge" him from the party. Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, has asked other Republicans whether he should call on Trump to resign. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said she will vote to impeach Trump, saying there has “never been a greater betrayal” by a president to his office and his oath to the Constitution.

The report also said “An online thread discussed specific calls for violence to include stating ‘Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in, and blood from their BLM and Pantifa slave soldiers being spilled. Get violent. Stop calling this a march, or rally, or a protest. Go there ready for war. We get our President or we die. NOTHING else will achieve this goal.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/capitol-riot-fbi-intelligence/2021/01/12/30d12748-546b-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/us/fbi-report-capitol.html))

5/ **Trump declared a state of emergency in Washington, D.C., citing the “emergency conditions” surrounding Biden’s inauguration**.
