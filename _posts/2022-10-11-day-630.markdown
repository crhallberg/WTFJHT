1/ **The International Monetary Fund warned that the world economy was headed for “stormy waters” and "the worst is yet to come."** The IMF's World Economic Outlook report forecasts that global growth will slow to 2.7% in 2023, compared with projected growth of 3.2% this year. Aside from the global financial crisis and the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, this is “the weakest growth profile since 2001.” The report added that "for many people 2023 will feel like a recession.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/business/imf-world-economy-forecast.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rapid-rise-in-rates-could-fuel-global-economic-disorder-imf-warns-11665497701?mod=hp_lead_pos2) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/economy/imf-world-economic-outlook/index.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/imf-cuts-global-growth-forecast-for-2023-warns-worst-is-yet-to-come.html))

2/ **The Biden administration suggested that the U.S. needs to "re-evaluate" its relationship with Saudi Arabia** following the decision by the OPEC\+ oil cartel to cut oil production by 2 million barrels. Days before the decision, U.S. officials [urged](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-defied-u-s-warnings-ahead-of-opec-production-cut-11665504230?mod=djemalertNEWS) their counterparts in Saudi Arabia and other big Gulf producers to delay the decision for another month, warning that cutting production would be viewed as siding with Russia in the Ukraine war. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, meanwhile, called on the Biden administration to "immediately freeze" U.S. cooperation with Saudi Arabia. And, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Biden would "work with Congress to think through what that relationship ought to look like going forward." Chuck Schumer added that several legislative responses are under consideration, including a halt to arms sales and a new antitrust measure.

3/ **Biden pledged to “continue providing Ukraine with the support needed to defend itself, including advanced air defense systems.”** The commitment follows Russia's decision to launch 84 cruise missiles against targets across Ukraine on Monday, which G-7 leaders have called “indiscriminate attacks” against civilians that amount to “war crimes.” Putin claimed the strikes were in response to what he described as acts of “terrorism” and other alleged "crimes" by Kyiv.

4/ **The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to reject Trump’s appeal over classified documents seized from Mar-a-Lago**. Trump had asked the Supreme Court to allow the special master reviewing the seized documents access to those marked as classified. The Justice Department, however, called the records “extraordinarily sensitive” and that Trump has no “plausible” claims of ownership over these sensitive government materials. They added that allowing the special master access to those records "would jeopardize national security ‘even by the judge alone, in chambers’” and “irreparably injure” the government. Separately, the Justice Department told Trump’s lawyers recently that they believe Trump still has government documents he took when he left the White House.

* **A lawyer for former president Donald Trump who signed a letter stating that a “diligent search” for classified records had been conducted and that all such documents had been given back to the government has spoken with the FBI**. Christina Bobb signed a letter in June certifying that “based upon the information that has been provided to me," Trump had returned all classified records sought by the government. The Aug. 8 search of Trump's home turned up additional records.

5/ **Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' decision to fly migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard may have violated the state's program for transporting undocumented individuals**. The program was launched in July to “facilitate the transport of unauthorized aliens from this state,” and documents released by DeSantis' office show that the transportation department sought a vendor to “implement and manage a program to relocate out of the State of Florida foreign nationals who are not lawfully present in the United States." On Sept. 14, however, two planes picked up 48 migrants in San Antonio – not Florida. The planes made a brief stop in Crestview, Fla. and then proceeded to Martha’s Vineyard later that day.
