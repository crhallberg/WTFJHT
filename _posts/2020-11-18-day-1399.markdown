On Monday, at least 1,707 new COVID-19 deaths were reported ‚Äì about one American every minute ‚Äì¬†and by Wednesday, the U.S. had recorded it's 250,000 death with a record 76,000 people hospitalized with the coronavirus. The White House coronavirus task force, meanwhile, stated in it‚Äôs weekly report that there is ‚Äúnow aggressive, unrelenting, expanding broad community spread across the country, reaching most counties, without evidence of improvement but rather, further deterioration.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/covid-3-milliion-plus-infected/2020/11/18/d9f079a8-2849-11eb-8fa2-06e7cbb145c0_story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/health/us-coronavirus-wednesday/index.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/18/us-coronavirus-deaths-latest-toll-white-house-taskforce-report) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-surpasses-250-000-coronavirus-deaths-virus-mortality-rate-n1248109) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/internal-white-house-report-warns-of-aggressive-unrelenting-covid-19-spread.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/covid-2020-11-18?mod=breakingnews))
