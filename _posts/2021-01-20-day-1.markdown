  pardon: Trump granted clemency to 143 people in his final hours as president, wiping
    away the convictions and prison sentences for a host of corrupt politicians and
    business executives. In total, Trump issued a batch of 73 pardons and 70 commutations,
    including a pardon for Stephen Bannon, his former White House chief strategist
    who was charged with defrauding donors to a private fundraising effort for construction
    of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and Elliott Broidy, who pleaded guilty in
    October to acting as an unregistered foreign agent and lobbying the Trump administration
    on behalf of foreign interests.
todayInOneSentence: Biden was sworn as the 46th president of the United States, moments
  after Kamala Harris took her oath of office; Trump, who refused to concede, never
  congratulated Biden and skipped his successor's swearing-in, held a small, socially
  distanced military-style send-off for himself before leaving for his Florida resort;
  Trump granted clemency to 143 people in his final hours as president and rescinded
  his administration's ethics pledge intended to "drain the swamp"; and Biden plans
  to make immediate and extensive use of executive orders to undo much of the last
  four years under Trump.

1/ **Biden was sworn as the 46th president of the United States**, moments after Kamala Harris took her oath of office, making her the first woman and the first woman of color to serve as vice president. ‚ÄúThis is America‚Äôs day,‚Äù Biden said as he began his Inaugural Address. ‚ÄúThis is democracy‚Äôs day.‚Äù Biden ‚Äì the oldest man to be sworn in as president at 78 ‚Äì described today as "our historic moment of crisis and challenge,‚Äù as he called on the nation to end its ‚Äúuncivil war" and embrace ‚ÄúUnity \[as\] the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you we will not fail.‚Äù Four years after Trump [attacked](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/01/20/Day-1/#7-trump-attacked-the-washington-esta) the Washington establishment throughout his Inaugural Address, declaring that the ‚ÄúAmerican carnage stops right here and stops right now,‚Äù Biden offered a direct rebuttal: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile ‚Äî and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/20/us/biden-inauguration/biden-sworn-in) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-sworn-in/2021/01/20/13465c90-5a7c-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-harris-inauguration-amid-covid-pandemic-d-c-lockdown-n1254732) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-biden-presidential-inauguration-2021-11611095413) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/joe-biden-presidential-inauguration/index.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/20/biden-inauguration-america-dystopia-460840))

* **üí° Biden inherits a country that is older, on shakier economic footing, and is more politically polarized**. "The coronavirus pandemic halted the 11-year economic expansion and drove up unemployment just as the typical American household was starting to enjoy sustained income growth. Americans were living longer until the pandemic exacted a swift, deadly toll." ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-inherits-an-older-polarized-and-financially-insecure-nation-11611153710))

2/ **Trump, who refused to concede, never congratulated Biden and skipped his successor's swearing-in, held a small, socially distanced military-style send-off for himself before leaving for his Florida resort**. ‚ÄúI hope they don‚Äôt raise your taxes,‚Äù Trump told the crowd of several hundred people at Joint Base Andrews. ‚ÄúBut if they do, I told you so." While Trump did not mention Biden by name, he did ‚Äúwish the new administration great luck and great success.‚Äù Trump concluded his remarks, vowing to ‚Äúbe back in some form‚Äù and, as the Village People‚Äôs ‚ÄúY.M.C.A.‚Äù began playing, Trump told his supporters: ‚ÄúHave a good life.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-leaves-white-house/2021/01/20/bb561da4-5a9e-11eb-b8bd-ee36b1cd18bf_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/20/trump-pledges-we-will-be-back-farewell-event-460675) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-20/trump-to-depart-with-airbase-send-off-before-biden-inaugural?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-biden-presidential-inauguration-2021-11611095413) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/20/trump-leaves-white-house-biden-to-be-sworn-in))

As it became clear that their long-awaited mass arrests of Biden and other ‚Äúdeep-state‚Äù Democrats, followed by the restoration of the Trump presidency, did not happen, QAnon believers began to wonder if they had been tricked.

4/ **Trump rescinded his administration's ethics pledge intended to "drain the swamp."** In 2017, Trump signed an executive order that barred political appointees from lobbying the government or working for foreign countries related to their agency for five years. At the time Trump joked that his political appointees would ‚Äúnot be subject to those commitments after noon January 20, 2021.‚Äù However, in a late-night executive order issued in the final hours of his presidency, Trump rescinded the executive order. The Trump White House did not offer any justification for the reversal.

Homeland Security signed legal agreements with state and local authorities in recent weeks that would require the agency to delay making changes for 180 days. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1254733))

6/ **Biden plans to make immediate and extensive use of executive orders to undo much of the last four years under Trump**. On Day One, Biden is expected to sign 17 executive actions, memorandums, and proclamations from the Oval Office to address the pandemic, economic relief, immigration, climate change, and racial equity. Biden will also sign executive orders to extend bans on pandemic-related home evictions and foreclosures, revoke the  permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, and reverse Trump's travel ban on several largely Muslim and African countries.
