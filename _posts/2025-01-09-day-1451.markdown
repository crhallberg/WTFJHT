1/ **The New York Court of Appeals – the highest court in the state – denied Trump’s request to block his Friday sentencing**. The decision leaves the U.S. Supreme Court as Trump’s final option to defer sentencing on 34 felony counts related to falsifying business records. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, meanwhile, urged the Supreme Court to deny Trump's bid to halt his sentencing, saying the "defendant makes the unprecedented claim that the temporary presidential immunity he will possess in the future fully immunizes him now, weeks before he even takes the oath of office." Bragg added, “It is axiomatic that there is only one president at a time [...] And as this court has repeatedly recognized, presidential immunity is strictly limited to the time of the president’s term in office.” Trump’s sentencing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. Friday.

"No Georgia court has ever disqualified a district attorney for the mere appearance of impropriety without the existence of an actual conflict of interest," Willis said.

2/ **Trump called Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito shortly before asking the court to block his sentencing in the New York election interference case involving falsified business records**. Alito said he took the call from Trump on behalf of a former law clerk who is seeking a job in the new Trump administration. “We did not discuss the emergency application he filed today, and indeed, I was not even aware at the time of our conversation that such an application would be filed,” Alito said. “We also did not discuss any other matter that is pending or might in the future come before the Supreme Court or any past Supreme Court decisions involving the President-elect.” Some judicial ethics experts and Democratic lawmakers called for Alito to recuse himself from the decision on whether Trump’s sentencing in New York can go forward.

3/ **Trump urged a federal appeals court to block the release of both volumes of special counsel Jack Smith’s final report** on Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his handling of classified documents after he left office and his refusal to return them. Attorney General Merrick Garland [plans](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2025/01/08/day-1450/#2-the-justice-department-plans-to-pu) to publicly release the volume on Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and disenfranchise millions of voters, but withhold the second part of the report concerning his handling of classified documents.

4/ **The Senate advanced the Republican-led Laken Riley Act in a bipartisan 84-9 procedural vote**, marking a major step toward passing legislation that requires ICE to detain undocumented immigrants charged with theft-related crimes. The legislation also allows state attorneys general to sue the federal government for perceived failures in immigration enforcement and to push for visa sanctions against countries that refuse to accept deportees. While the legislation passed the House earlier this week, final passage in the Senate is uncertain due to Democratic calls for amendments addressing overreach and potential misuse of provisions, including those empowering states to sue the federal government over enforcement failures. Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, however have resisted any efforts to amend the bill, framing it as a critical tool for public safety and immigration reform. Nevertheless, 31 Democrats joined Republicans to clear a 60-vote threshold to begin debate.

5/ **Trump reportedly plans to issue nearly 100 executive orders starting on his first day in office to address immigration, energy, and federal workforce policies**, aiming to fulfill his campaign promises to reverse Biden-era regulations. Key priorities include reinstating Title 42 for rapid migrant expulsions, completing the border wall, implementing deportation mechanisms, and defunding sanctuary cities. Trump also plans to authorize drilling on federal lands, freeze hiring, mandate federal workers’ return to offices, and halt Biden-era regulations that are not yet finalized.

6/ **A federal judge in Kentucky blocked Biden’s Title IX rule that expanded anti-discrimination protections to LGBTQ+ students**, saying it exceeded presidential authority. The regulation, which barred discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, faced legal challenges from Republican-led states and was criticized for infringing on free speech by requiring educators to use students’ preferred pronouns. The ruling vacated the rule nationwide, marking a victory for conservative groups and setting the stage for Trump’s previous promise to end the rules “on day one."
