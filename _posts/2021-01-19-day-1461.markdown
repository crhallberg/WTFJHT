1/ **In a farewell video, Trump claimed that he ‚Äútook on the tough battles‚Äù during his four years in office and vowed that ‚Äúthe movement we started is only just beginning.‚Äù** Trump did not concede, take responsibility for encouraging his supporters to attack the Capitol, or mention Biden by name in his farewell address.‚ÄúWe did what we came here to do," Trump said, "and so much more.‚Äù Pence, meanwhile, confirmed he will not attend Trump's farewell event tomorrow, but will instead attend the inauguration of Biden and Kamala Harris. Trump leaves office as the only twice-impeached U.S. president.

2/ **Mitch McConnell said the mob that stormed the Capitol was ‚Äúfed lies‚Äù and ‚Äúprovoked by the president‚Äù into violence**, referring to Trump's attempts to overturn the election based on his baseless claims of voter fraud. McConnell's remarks came on his last full day as majority leader, shortly before he met with Chuck Schumer to work out rules for Trump's Senate impeachment trial for ‚Äúwillful incitement of insurrection.‚Äù Former Attorney General William Barr, meanwhile, said that questioning the legitimacy of the Nov. 3 election ‚Äúprecipitated the riot," but he didn't blame Trump for inciting the mob.

Biden‚Äôs incoming White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, tweeted "On the advice of our medical team, the Administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26.
