1/ **Mark Meadows testified to a federal grand jury as part of special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into Trump**. Smith is overseeing two federal investigations of Trump: his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office. Trump’s former chief of staff was reportedly asked about both subjects. [Earlier this year](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/03/27/day-797/#4-a-federal-judge-ordered-mark-meado), a federal judge rejected Trump's claims of executive privilege and ordered Meadows and other former Trump aides to testify before the grand jury. Smith also [subpoenaed](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/02/16/day-758/#2-the-special-counsel-investigating) Meadows for testimony and documents related to the probe.

2/ **Steve Bannon was subpoenaed for documents and testimony by a federal grand jury in Washington as part of the investigation into Trump's efforts to stay in office**. The subpoena was sent in late May. Bannon was [previously charged](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/07/25/day-552/#11-steve-bannon-was-found-guilty-of) with contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena for documents and testimony issued by the Jan. 6 committee. He was [convicted](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/10/17/day-636/#6-the-justice-department-recommended) of two charges in July 2022 and the Justice Department recommended he be sentenced to six months in jail and fined $200,000. Separately, Trump's former White House communication direction voluntarily met with federal prosecutors. Alyssa Farah Griffin provided information about Trump leading up to the Jan. 6 attack, including his state of mind and what he knew about his baseless claims of election fraud.

3/ **A former Trump aide testified to a federal grand jury in Miami about Trump's handling of classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago**. Taylor Budowich was Trump’s spokesman at the time when the National Archives [retrieved 15 boxes of documents](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/02/07/day-384/#6-the-national-archives-retrieved-15) from Mar-a-Lago, which should have been turned over to the agency when he left the White House. After handing over the 15 boxes, which contained highly sensitive documents, Trump's aides drafted a statement asserting that all the presidential material had been returned, which was false (see: [the 27 additional boxes of documents the FBI retrieved during the court-authorized search of Mar-a-Lago](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/08/09/day-567/#1-the-fbi-executed-a-federal-search)). Prosecutors have the draft statement. Budowich now runs Make America Great Again Inc., the super-PAC supporting Trump’s 2024 bid for reelection. Separately, about two dozen Secret Service agents assigned to Trump’s security detail at Mar-a-Lago were subpoenaed or have already appeared before a federal grand jury in Washington related Trump’s handling of classified documents.

4/ **Pence argued that Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election should disqualify him from running for president**. “Anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States,” Pence said, adding that “Jan. 6 was a tragic day in the life of our nation" and "Trump’s reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol.” No other major Republican candidate for president has mentioned Jan. 6 in an announcement speech. Pence, who is the first vice president in modern times to challenge his old running mate for the party’s nomination, concluded: “And anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president again.” ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4038723-pence-argues-jan-6-is-disqualifying-for-trump-as-he-launches-campaign/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/us/politics/pence-trump-2024-announcement.html))

5/ **Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas did not file his annual financial disclosure by the deadline**. Instead, he asked for an extension following [reporting and criticism](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/04/06/day-807/#1-supreme-court-justice-clarence-tho) about his decision to not disclose luxury vacations, estate sales, and gifts paid for by a Republican megadonor in previous years. Thomas received a 90-day extension to submit his required disclosure. Justice Samuel Alito also requested an extension.
