1/ **House Speaker Mike Johnson lacks the Republican support needed to pass the party’s budget ahead of today's a planned vote**. With a 218-215 majority, he can afford only one defection if all Democrats vote no, but at least four Republicans have already pledged to oppose the measure. Johnson, [meanwhile](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-face-headwinds-seek-pass-budget-trumps-agenda-rcna193436), asked conservatives to pray for the budget, saying “This is a prayer request. Just pray this through for us, because it is very high stakes." Johnson said he plans to call a vote Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET, but also said: "There may be a vote tonight, there may not. Stay tuned." The budget framework includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in spending reductions, which would add roughly $3 trillion to the deficit over a decade. It also calls for raising the debt limit by $4 trillion and includes over $100 billion in new spending on immigration enforcement and the military. To offset some of the tax cuts, the plan requires the House Energy and Commerce Committee to find $880 billion in savings, with Medicaid – the nation’s largest health insurance program – expected to provide the bulk of those cuts. Medicaid covers over 70 million people and serves as the largest source of funding for states, raising concerns that states may have to either cut coverage, raise taxes, or reduce spending on other programs to compensate for the loss of federal support.

Overall, 82% of voters said Medicaid cuts were unacceptable. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5163193-trump-voters-oppose-medicaid-cuts-poll/))

2/ **Twenty-one federal technology staffers resigned from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, citing concerns over dismantling public services**. The employees, formerly part of the U.S. Digital Service, said they would "not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.” Their resignation letter warned that Musk’s efforts to shrink the federal workforce relied on inexperienced political appointees and posed security risks. The White House dismissed the resignations, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying "Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock." ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/doge-elon-musk-federal-government-resignations-usds-6b7e9b7022e6d89d69305e9510f2a43c) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/doge-civil-service-employees-quit-musk.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/nx-s1-5308095/doge-staff-resignations-elon-musk) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-02-25-25))

3/ **Nearly 40% of federal contracts canceled under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency are expected to yield no savings**, according to the administration’s own data. Of the 2,300 contracts terminated, 794 had already been fully paid or legally obligated, making the cuts largely symbolic. Meanwhile, DOGE deleted its five largest reported cost savings after media outlets exposed major errors in its claims. The agency initially claimed an $8 billion cut at ICE, which was actually $8 million, and mistakenly listed a single $655 million USAID cut three times. It also misreported a $232 million Social Security cut, which was only $560,000. Despite removing these errors, DOGE now claims it has saved $65 billion, without explaining the discrepancies. Further, some newly added savings also appear inaccurate, including a $1.9 billion Treasury cut that predates DOGE’s existence.

4/ **Trump confirmed that tariffs on Canada and Mexico will take effect next month, ending a 30-day suspension**. The tariffs include a 25% tax on Mexican imports and a 10% duty on Canadian energy products, with Trump claiming they are necessary to address trade imbalances and border security. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed confidence in reaching an agreement before the deadline, while Canadian officials have warned of potential economic fallout. Economists say the tariffs could worsen inflation and slow economic growth, with potential retaliatory measures from Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Trump also reiterated his plans for broader “reciprocal” tariffs starting in April. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/trump-says-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico-will-go-forward.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-macron-canada-mexicoreciprocal-49caafc1240db7e17cfb45e71520dc98))

5/ **Consumer confidence declined in February as concerns about inflation and new tariffs grow**. The Conference Board’s index fell to 98.3, the largest monthly drop since 2021, with inflation expectations rising to 6% over the next year. The cost of essential goods, including eggs, increased, and uncertainty over trade policies contributed to a more cautious outlook on jobs and income. The Federal Reserve is monitoring inflation expectations, but has not signaled any immediate policy changes.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **A federal judge declined to temporarily restore the Associated Press’ access to certain White House events** after Trump banned the outlet for refusing to use his preferred name, “Gulf of America,” instead of “Gulf of Mexico.” Judge Trevor McFadden ruled that AP had not proven “irreparable harm” but set a March 20 hearing to reconsider the case. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/24/politics/ap-white-house-access-ruling) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/24/trump-associated-press-court-hearing-00205852) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-24/judge-won-t-restore-associated-press-white-house-access-for-now) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/24/trump-ap-access-lawsuit-white-house-filing))

2. **The White House will now decide which news outlets participate in the presidential press pool** – not the independent White House Correspondents' Association. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the change would “restore power back to the American people” by including new media voices. The White House Correspondents’ Association condemned the move, calling it a threat to press freedom. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/trump-white-house-press-pool-access-00206001) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/media/trump-white-house-press.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/white-house-says-it-will-now-pick-and-choose-pool-reporters) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/25/white-house-trump-press-pool))

3. **A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to comply with a court order to unfreeze foreign aid funding and pay outstanding invoices by Wednesday night**. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali criticized administration lawyers for failing to provide clear answers about compliance. The aid freeze, imposed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, halted $15.9 billion in funding, leading to lawsuits from nonprofits and contractors. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/foreign-aid-funding-state-department-022736) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-usaid-state-department-foreign-assistance-funding-contractors-grants/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/25/trump-admin-foreign-funding-judge-usaid))

4. **A federal judge in Seattle blocked Trump’s executive order suspending the U.S. refugee admissions program**. Judge Jamal Whitehead ruled that Trump’s directive amounted to a “nullification of congressional will” and exceeded the president’s authority. The lawsuit, brought by refugee aid groups, argued that the order disrupted services and left approved refugees stranded. The Justice Department signaled it may appeal the decision. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-refugee-seattle-ruling-lawsuit-eef485154e2a3f008a01d6790ce0ee06) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/trump-refugee-executive-order-injunction-federal-judge-00206016) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/25/trump-refugee-program-judge))

5. **A group led by former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince proposed a $25 billion mass deportation plan to the Trump White House**, calling for “processing camps” on military bases, 100 private planes, and a “small army” of deputized private citizens. The plan, which aims to remove 12 million people by 2026, includes mass deportation hearings and bounty rewards for local law enforcement. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/documents-military-contractors-mass-deportations-022648))

6. **TV screens at the Department of Housing and Urban Development  headquarters displayed an AI-generated video of Trump kissing Elon Musk’s feet, accompanied by the phrase “LONG LIVE THE REAL KING.”** The prank coincided with the first day of Trump’s ban on remote work. Employees had to manually turn off each monitor, and HUD officials condemned the prank as a “waste of taxpayer dollars” and promised disciplinary action.
