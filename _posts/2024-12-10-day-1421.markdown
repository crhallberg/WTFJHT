1/ **Trump’s first term Justice Department secretly obtained phone and text message records from two members of Congress, 43 staffers – including Kash Patel, his pick to lead the FBI – and eight journalists**, according to a new report by the department’s internal watchdog. The report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that the Justice Department didn’t act with political motives, but instead failed to comply with its own procedures when it investigated who in the government had leaked classified information to journalists that detailed contacts between Trump and Russia. Prosecutors secretly used subpoenas and other legal processes to obtain communication records, including phone and email metadata but not the content itself, from third-party providers. They attached gag orders that barred the companies from informing their customers. "As a result, dozens of congressional staffers became part of the subject pool in a federal criminal investigation for nothing more than performing constitutionally authorized oversight of the executive branch," the report said. Horowitz urged the Justice Department to strengthen policies to prevent future abuses against lawmakers, staff, and journalists, warning that its tactics "risks chilling Congress' ability to conduct oversight of the executive branch" and could expose whistleblower activity or other sensitive information.

2/ **Trump’s “border czar” promised that mass deportation efforts would “start right here in Chicago” immediately after Trump’s inauguration**. “Chicago’s in trouble because your mayor sucks and your governor sucks,” Tom Homan said, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Do not impede us." Homan also threatened to arrest "a hell of a lot more people than our priorities,” telling Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other Democratic officials to “get the hell out of the way.” While Homan said there was no plan to separate families, he acknowledged “it may happen" and "if you put yourself in that position it’s on you."

3/ **A group of 77 Nobel laureates urged Senate lawmakers to reject Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services**. In an open letter, the group argued that putting Kennedy – one of the nation’s leading vaccine skeptics –  in charge of HHS, which oversees agencies handling food and drug safety, disease epidemics, and health insurance would “put the public’s health in jeopardy and undermine America’s global leadership in the health sciences.” The group also called Kennedy “a belligerent critic of respected agencies,” including the FDA, the National Institutes of Health, and the CDC, and said the department’s leader should “continue to nurture and improve − not threaten − these important and highly respected institutions and their employees.” Trump recently said he’ll have Kennedy investigate the [repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/12/09/day-1420/#4-trump-plans-to-have-robert-f-kenne) that vaccines cause autism and supports [Kennedy’s plan to remove fluoride](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/11/04/day-1385/#4-trump-didn%E2%80%99t-rule-out-banning-vacc) from public water.

4/ **New York Attorney General Letitia James denied Trump’s request to dismiss the $486 million civil fraud judgment against him**. Trump argued [the case](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/02/20/day-1127/#5-a-manhattan-judge-ordered-trump-to) should be dropped “for the health of our Republic,” claiming it would hinder his ability to perform presidential duties. Deputy Solicitor General Judith Vale rejected this argument, stating in a letter to Trump’s attorney that his upcoming inauguration “has no bearing” on the trial’s outcome. Separately, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg opposed dismissing [Trump’s May conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/30/day-1227/#1-trump-a-former-u-s-president-and-t). Bragg argued that the request for presidential immunity exceeded what was necessary to protect the office. However, he proposed sentencing alternatives, such as delaying sentencing until Trump leaves office, ensuring no jail time, or closing proceedings without vacating the jury verdict or indictment. Trump’s sentencing has already been delayed three times.

### ✏️ Notables. 

1. **The Supreme Court appeared likely to rule that a federal agency had sufficiently reviewed the environmental impacts of a proposed railway in Utah**, potentially narrowing the scope of environmental reviews required by federal law. The case involves an 88-mile railway in Utah intended to connect oil fields to a national rail network. The Surface Transportation Board conducted a 3,600-page environmental review, but opponents argued it failed to consider specific harms. A decision in favor of the project could limit federal environmental review obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/supreme-court-environmental-reviews.html))

2. **Trump pledged to fast-track permits and approvals, including environmental reviews, for companies investing $1 billion or more in the U.S.**, aiming to boost domestic energy, infrastructure, and technology sectors. Details on eligibility and the scope of projects, however, remain unclear. His pick of Lee Zeldin, a supporter of deregulation with limited environmental policy experience, to lead the EPA highlights a focus on reducing regulatory hurdles.

3. **Elon Musk warned Republican lawmakers against opposing Trump’s nominees or agenda**, using his financial and political influence to pressure compliance through potential primary challenges and targeted campaigns. GOP strategists warn that Musk’s tactics could destabilize party unity or backfire by weakening Republican incumbents in competitive districts. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-politics-trump-7e26c829af224a1f9d67c27cea085e68))

4. **Trump referred to Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau as the "Governor" of the "Great State of Canada" while defending his plan for a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports**. Trump's late-night post on Truth Social appears to mock Trudeau while promoting his upcoming tariff policies. [Trudeau criticized the tariffs as economically damaging](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/12/03/day-1414/#4-trump-%E2%80%9Cjoked%E2%80%9D-to-prime-minister-ju) and argued they would increase costs for American consumers while undermining affordability goals.

5. **Advocacy groups are urging Biden to commute all federal death sentences before leaving office**, citing concerns about the fairness and morality of the death penalty as Trump prepares to reinstate federal executions. The Justice Department paused federal executions under Biden but continued to defend and seek new death sentences, creating uncertainty over his administration's stance. Trump’s incoming presidency signals a likely revival of federal executions, heightening calls for Biden to act decisively. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/12/09/biden-death-row-commute-

6. **Democrats’ focus on liberal immigration policies to secure Latino votes misjudged voter priorities**, contributing to significant Republican gains among Latino voters and potentially costing Democrats the White House in 2016 and 2024. For years, Democrats assumed Latinos prioritized immigration reform and moved left on the issue to secure their support. This strategy overlooked the economic concerns that dominate Latino voter priorities, creating a disconnect between party messaging and voter preferences. Republican candidates like Trump capitalized on this, gaining significant ground among Latino voters despite restrictive immigration stances. The 2024 election underscored this miscalculation, as immigration salience hurt Democrats while failing to bolster Latino support. Moving forward, Democrats must realign their policies with the broader concerns of Latino voters to avoid repeating past mistakes. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/12/democrats-latino-vote-immigration/680945/))

7. **Democratic governors are balancing defiance toward Trump’s immigration crackdown with openness to cooperating on targeted enforcement and border control**. While governors expressed a willingness to work with the Trump administration on deporting undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes and tightening border control, they rejected mass deportations and family separations. Many emphasized protecting immigrant communities, businesses reliant on immigrant labor, and humanitarian principles. Governors are preparing for potential conflicts over federal requests to use state resources for deportations while exploring legal and political strategies to push back. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/democrats-trump-immigration-crackdown.html))

8. **Trump’s promises on immigration, federal spending, and foreign policy face significant practical challenges and lack clear plans**. Trump has pledged to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours, deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, and cut $2 trillion in annual federal spending. These goals lack clear execution strategies and would require large-scale resources and coordination. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/trump-promises.html)[](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/us/politics/trump-promises.html))

9. **Trump’s presidency and ownership of Truth Social’s parent company raise concerns about SEC conflicts of interest and weakened regulatory enforcement**. Trump Media, the parent of Truth Social, is under scrutiny for misleading investors and could face SEC investigations. As president, Trump’s control over the SEC chair appointment raises fears of compromised oversight. Critics warn this could damage trust in U.S. financial regulation and market integrity. State-level investigations may become critical if federal oversight is weakened.
