1/ **The Trump administration ordered all federal diversity, equity, and inclusion employees to be placed on paid leave and directed agencies to dismantle DEI offices and programs entirely**. The Office of Personnel Management instructed federal agencies to shut down DEI-related initiatives, remove public references to the programs, and prepare plans for staff layoffs by the end of the month. Trump described DEI programs as "radical and wasteful" and claimed they “undermine our national unity” by prioritizing identity over merit. The order also required agencies to investigate private sector practices and federal contractors for potential “illegal discrimination” linked to DEI programs.

2/ **The Pentagon will deploy an additional 1,500 active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border**. These forces will join approximately 2,200 active-duty troops already stationed at the border as part of ongoing support for Customs and Border Protection. This deployment marks the first wave of a larger plan that could involve up to 10,000 troops. The troops, tasked with logistical and support roles, are prohibited by law from engaging in law enforcement activities but may assist in operations like migrant transportation and intelligence support. The White House framed the move as a fulfillment of Trump’s campaign promise to prioritize homeland security and combat illegal immigration. One defense official, meanwhile, said: “We’ve been told to treat this like a national emergency because it’s been declared a national emergency. Don’t be surprised if you see Marines being dropped off by helicopters.” ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/politics/us-military-troops-southern-border/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2025-01-22/urgent-pentagon-to-send-up-to-1-500-active-duty-troops-to-help-secure-us-mexico-border-officials-say) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-military-preparing-send-additional-1000-troops-border-official-says-2025-01-22/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/22/trump-presidency-news/#link-BPWAZ7OYRNFYXDQLOHBCMNO5TA) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/live/trump-presidency-day-3-updates))

3/ **The Trump administration revoked policies protecting "sensitive locations" such as schools, churches, and hospitals from immigration enforcement, allowing federal agents to conduct arrests at these sites**. The Department of Homeland Security said the policy change would help apprehend "criminal aliens" and enforce immigration laws without restrictions, emphasizing that law enforcement officials are trusted to use discretion. “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest,” Homeland Security said in a statement. Advocates warned the change could deter migrants from accessing essential services like medical care and education. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/21/nx-s1-5269899/trump-immigration-enforcement-schools-churches) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-enforcement-sensitive-locations-trump-ab0d2d2652e9df696f14410ebb52a1fc) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/21/trump-ice-churches-schools-hospitals-sensitive-areas) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-immigration-ice-arrests-sensitive-locations/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/22/justice-immigrantion-memo-sanctuary-cities/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-immigration-enforcement-f0e3fc616da9746796378d1cd6385b1b) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-deportations-migrants-border-asylum-hearings/))

* **KKK flyers promoting racist propaganda and urging immigrants to “leave now” were distributed across several Northern Kentucky neighborhoods**. The flyers, distributed around Trump’s inauguration, depict an image of Uncle Sam kicking out an immigrant family and encourage citizens to monitor and report immigrants. ([WKRC](https://local12.com/news/local/very-scary-kkk-flyers-spark-concern-northern-kentucky-neighborhoods-bellevue-fort-mitchell-ft-wright-cincinnati-ku-klux-klan-racist-racism-hate-fearmongering-deportation-immigration-propaganda-naacp-police-investigation) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/22/kkk-immigrants-flyers-kentucky) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5100467-kentucky-kkk-trump-immigration-crackdown/))

4/ **Congress passed the Laken Riley Act, mandating the detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants charged with certain crimes**, sending it to Trump for his signature. The bill, named after a Georgia nursing student killed by an undocumented immigrant, passed with bipartisan support, including votes from 46 House Democrats and 12 Senate Democrats. It expands the list of crimes requiring detention and deportation to include theft, burglary, and assault on law enforcement officers. ICE warned the bill could cost $26 billion to implement in its first year due to resource shortages.

5/ **The Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police condemned Trump’s pardoning of about 1,500 people convicted for their involvement in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot**. “Allowing those convicted of these crimes to be released early diminishes accountability and devalues the sacrifices made by courageous law enforcement officers and their families,” the Fraternal Order of Police and International Association of Chiefs of Police said in a joint statement. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger said the move prioritizes politics over policing and risks damaging officer morale. Meanwhile, Officer Michael Fanone, who previously testified about being “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country,” said: “I have been betrayed by my country [...] My family, my children, and myself are less safe today because of Donald Trump and his supporters."

6/ **Trump directed federal health agencies, including the CDC, FDA, and NIH, to pause all external communications**, such as sharing scientific reports, health advisories, and website updates, until further notice. This includes resources like the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and updates on public health threats like the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak. Dr. Richard Besser, former CDC acting director, warned that delaying the release of crucial information “puts our health at risk.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/22/trump-cdc-nih-hhs-health-agencies-communications) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/health/hhs-cdc-fda-trump-pause-communication/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/21/trump-hhs-cdc-fda-communication-pause/))

7/ **During an inaugural prayer service at Washington National Cathedral, Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde urged Trump to "have mercy" on immigrants, LGBTQ individual and "the people in our country who are scared now.”** Trump, however, dismissed the sermon as "nasty," "ungracious," "boring," and "not compelling or smart" in a Truth Social post, accusing Budde of bringing politics into the church. The service occurred a day after Trump signed executive orders rolling back transgender protections, limiting asylum, and ending birthright citizenship. Trump demanded an apology from Budde and the Episcopal Church. Budde, however, defended her remarks, saying “Unity requires mercy and compassion. I was trying to speak a truth that I felt needed to be said, but as respectfully as I could.” She added: “The culture of contempt that has become normalized in this country threatens to destroy us.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/trump-bishop.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/bishop-trump-inaugural-prayer-service-lgbtq-immigration-policie-rcna188590) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-criticizes-sermon-show-mercy-lgbtq-people-immigrants/story?id=117950533) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/21/trump-mercy-prayer-service-national-cathedral/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/donld-trump-launches-savage-attack-on-bishop-mariann-budde-who-asked-for-mercy-for-minorities-lgbtq-immigrants/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5099730-donald-trump-criticizes-bishop-transgender-migrants/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-inaugural-prayer-service-washington-national-cathedral-interfaith-a95b36f962be93c8647cc5144266da11))

### ✏️ Notables. 

1. **The White House website page for the U.S. Constitution returns a “404 error.”** The Trump administration has not clarified if or when the explaining the Constitution's role in government will be restored. ([Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/the-u-s-constitution-delivers-a-404-now-2000552847))

2. **The Trump administration removed the Spanish-language version of the White House website and its related social media**. The abrupt removal sparked criticism from Hispanic advocacy groups, who argued it alienates Spanish-speaking Americans and immigrants. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-white-house-spanish-language-website-62224890c5b05c8ce0878358ba4a5266))

3. **The Trump administration has sidelined approximately 160 National Security Council staffers**, requiring them to work from home while the White House conducts a personnel review to align the NSC with Trump’s "America First" agenda. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-security-council-staffers-d167985d61c96dd278b0e58a402ff865) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/22/trump-national-security-council-civil-servants) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/22/trump-waltz-national-security-council-officials/))

4. **Trump signed executive orders reversing several Biden-era health care policies, including initiatives to lower prescription drug costs and expand Medicaid protections**. These orders included rescinding efforts to cap out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries and extending Obamacare open enrollment periods. Experts noted the changes are unlikely to significantly affect health care costs immediately but signal a shift in priorities. Trump’s administration has also left major Biden policies, such as the $2,000 annual cap on Medicare prescription drug costs, intact for now. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-reverses-biden-policies-drug-pricing-obamacare-rcna188555) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/prescription-pulse/2025/01/22/trump-pulls-back-biden-drug-pricing-action-00199717) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5098715-trump-executive-order-biden-prescription-drug-costs/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/21/medicaid-cuts-trump-democrats/))

5. **Elon Musk publicly criticized Trump’s $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project**, claiming the project’s backers lack sufficient funding. Musk argued that SoftBank, one of the initiative’s primary investors, had “well under $10 billion secured.” The Stargate project, led by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, plans to invest up to $500 billion over four years to build AI infrastructure in the U.S., which Trump called a “monumental undertaking.” ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/22/stargate-elon-musk-trump-altman-openai-project) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/tech/elon-musk-trump-stargate-openai/index.html) / [CNBC News](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/22/musk-trump-ai-stargate-openai-softbank.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/musk-pours-cold-water-on-trump-backed-stargate-ai-project-53428d16))

6. **Trump threatened to impose sanctions and tariffs on Russia if Putin doesn’t agree to a deal to end the war in Ukraine**. In a post on his social platform, Trump urged Putin to “MAKE A DEAL” and warned that failure to end the conflict would lead to severe economic penalties. Trump claimed he wanted to help Russia avoid further harm, emphasizing that “no more lives should be lost.” Trump’s comments follow his campaign pledge to end the war quickly, though he acknowledged that achieving peace could take longer than anticipated. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/22/nx-s1-5270883/trump-threat-russia-ukraine-war-tariffs-sanctions) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-22/trump-tells-putin-to-make-a-deal-on-ukraine-or-face-new-costs) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/22/trump-tariffs-russia-end-ukraine-war) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-war-truth-social-316f0fe5))

7. **Biden wished Trump "all the best for the next four years" in the letter he left in the Resolute Desk** as he departed the Oval Office. The letter emphasized the importance of the presidency and expressed hopes for prosperity, peace, and grace for the nation. Trump described the letter as "very nice" and "inspirational," adding that he appreciated the gesture. The letter continued the tradition of outgoing presidents leaving notes for their successors, which began with Ronald Reagan in 1989.
