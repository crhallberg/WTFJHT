1/ **A joint session of Congress certified Trump's 2024 victory without incident** four years after he tried to overturn his 2020 election loss by encouraging his followers to march to the Capitol and ‚Äúfight like hell‚Äù to stop Congress from certifying Biden as president. Kamala Harris oversaw the proceedings as president of the Senate, certifying Trump's win, including her own defeat, and announced the final tally: 312 to 226. Unlike the 2021 certification that spanned two days with objections, evacuations, and an angry, violent mob that injured about 140 Capitol and D.C. police officers, this year‚Äôs proceedings concluded calmly in under an hour with no disturbances or objections. Four years ago, 147 Republicans voted against certifying some states‚Äô results. Later that month, the House impeached Trump for a second time. He was acquitted by the Senate. Following certification of the election, Harris, who hasn‚Äôt given an interview since her loss in November, told reporters that the process ‚Äúwas about what should be the norm and what the American people should be able to take for granted, which is that one of the most important pillars of our democracy is that there will be a peaceful transfer of power \[...\] And today, America‚Äôs democracy stood.‚Äù Trump, meanwhile, posted on his social media platform: "A BIG MOMENT IN HISTORY."

* üí° **Trump rebranded Jan. 6 as a political asset**, using conspiracy theories and martyrdom narratives to fuel his return to power while undermining democratic norms and accountability. By downplaying the violence and recasting rioters as patriots, Trump reframed the Capitol attack to bolster his political resurgence and re-election campaign. As he prepares to retake office, his promises to pardon rioters and pursue political retribution aim to cement this alternate history. These actions erode accountability, destabilize democratic institutions, and set dangerous precedents for political discourse and governance. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/us/politics/january-6-capitol-riot-trump.html))

* üí° **Trump, who instigated the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, will return to the presidency in two weeks, marking an unprecedented comeback amid unresolved questions about accountability for the violence and its implications for democracy**. Despite facing criminal charges, public inquiries, and widespread condemnation, Trump evaded accountability, with his 2024 election win ending efforts to hold him responsible. His reelection represents a normalization of political violence and a broader failure to reckon with the assault on democratic norms. As the Capitol prepares to host his inauguration, it stands as a stark reminder of the events four years prior and their lasting impact on American governance. ([Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-got-away-with-instigating-jan-6-capitol-attack-1235226493/))

* üí° **In four years, Trump transformed the perception of Jan. 6 from a violent insurrection into a narrative of patriotism and persecution**, effectively mobilizing his base and neutralizing political opposition. Despite evidence and widespread condemnation at the time, Trump and his allies rewrote the event as a defense of democracy and used this revisionist framing to regain political power. His propaganda echoes historical patterns like the "Lost Cause" myth of the Confederacy, but its swift adoption demonstrates the potency of modern media and political polarization. This victory complicates efforts to uphold accountability and preserve historical truth. ([HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-jan-6-lost-cause_n_67786658e4b03c84a28dacd5))

* üí° **Trump‚Äôs return to the presidency coincides with efforts to downplay the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection**, a moment of violence and democratic vulnerability that resulted in over 1,250 convictions. Despite the Supreme Court's decision to extend immunity for Trump‚Äôs actions as president and the Justice Department‚Äôs dismissal of charges against him, the historical significance of January 6 persists. Trump‚Äôs pardoning of convicted rioters and revisionist narratives risk eroding public accountability and the lessons drawn from the insurrection. Preserving the truth about January 6 is essential to understanding its impact and safeguarding democratic institutions. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-06/don-t-let-trump-whitewash-the-truth-about-jan-6))

* üí° **Matthew Yglesias argues that the normalization of Trump‚Äôs actions surrounding Jan. 6 by the conservative movement poses a long-term threat to democratic accountability and governance**. Once widely criticized for inciting the Capitol riot, Trump now faces little intra-party pushback, and his intent to pardon the rioters reflects the risks of unchecked executive power. Yglesias warns that broad support from influential elites and an emboldened Trump administration could enable further abuses of power, emphasizing the need for accountability and vigilance to safeguard democracy. ([Slow Boring](https://www.slowboring.com/p/four-years-later))

* üí° **William Kristol and Andrew Egger argue that Jan. 6, 2021, represents a national day of shame**, now compounded by the normalization and celebration of its instigator, Donald Trump, as he prepares to re-enter the presidency. They critique Trump‚Äôs supporters for enabling the rewriting of history, the GOP‚Äôs leadership for blocking accountability, and the Senate for its upcoming role in confirming nominees who may perpetuate Trump‚Äôs authoritarian tendencies. Kristol and Egger emphasize the need for resistance to this erasure of truth and highlight the risk of further democratic backsliding under Trump‚Äôs leadership. ([Bulwark](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/our-national-day-of-shame))

* üí° **Eric Lutz argues that Trump‚Äôs return to the presidency represents not only a political victory but also a successful effort to rewrite the narrative of Jan. 6, 2021**. While initially condemned for inciting the Capitol riot, Trump has reframed the day as one of victimhood and loyalty, securing political support and minimizing accountability. With plans to pardon January 6 rioters and the backing of a polarized electorate, Trump‚Äôs administration signals heightened risks to democratic norms, as he now has both the power and public mandate to further erode institutional safeguards.

2/ **Biden urged Americans not to forget or rewrite the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, accusing Trump and his supporters of an "unrelenting effort"  to "rewrite ‚Äî even erase ‚Äî the history of that day.‚Äù** In an op-ed published in the Washington Post, Biden contrasted the transfer of power that he‚Äôs overseeing with the one that Trump oversaw four years ago. ‚ÄúFor much of our history, this proceeding was treated as pro forma, a routine act,‚Äù Biden wrote. ‚ÄúBut after what we all witnessed on Jan. 6, 2021, we know we can never again take it for granted.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúTo tell us we didn‚Äôt see what we all saw with our own eyes. To dismiss concerns about it as some kind of partisan obsession. To explain it away as a protest that just got out of hand. This is not what happened.‚Äù Trump has repeatedly called Jan. 6 ‚Äúa beautiful day‚Äù and suggested he‚Äôll pardon the rioters on his "first day" back in office, claiming they're "hostages" who've been "wrongfully imprisoned" for acting on his behalf.

* üí° **Trump‚Äôs promise to pardon Jan. 6 convicts could embolden violent extremists, undermine law enforcement, and distort the public‚Äôs understanding of the Capitol attack**. Critics warn that absolving these offenders risks legitimizing political violence, aiding recruitment by extremist groups, and weakening the rule of law. Trump‚Äôs narrative of martyrdom and political persecution is paired with plans to replace FBI leadership, target critics, and rewrite the events of Jan. 6, raising concerns about the long-term implications for democracy and public safety.

* üí° **Victims of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack expressed feelings of betrayal as Trump continues to downplay the violence and pledges to pardon convicted rioters**. Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, injured during the attack, said Trump‚Äôs return to power feels like a dismissal of the sacrifices made to defend the Capitol. Families of victims, such as Officer Brian Sicknick‚Äôs relatives, have condemned Trump‚Äôs rhetoric, describing it as a dangerous rewriting of history that minimizes the attack‚Äôs significance and the lives lost or affected.

* üí° **Nearly 1,600 people have been prosecuted for their involvement in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack**, with outcomes ranging from prison sentences to acquittals. Defendants charged with minor crimes have largely returned to their lives, though many face lasting consequences, including financial hardship, damaged reputations, and strained relationships. While some regret their actions, others remain unrepentant, perceiving their prosecution as unjust and further fueling political grievances. Despite the legal repercussions, Trump has vowed to pardon many of those convicted, intensifying the polarization surrounding the event. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/us/politics/trump-capitol-attack-jan-6.html))

* üí° **Trump‚Äôs second presidential term is expected to launch with a rapid series of executive orders and legislative actions, dubbed a "shock and awe" approach**, focusing on immigration, energy, and culture-war issues while sparking potential controversies like pardoning Jan. 6 rioters. His agenda, driven by a Republican-controlled Congress, may include sweeping changes but also norm-defying moves aimed at agitating opponents and dominating media cycles. The challenge for journalists and the public will be to discern substantive actions from provocations designed to distract or overwhelm. ([Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trumps-shock-and-awe-campaign))

3/ **A New York judge upheld Trump‚Äôs conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records but indicated he would impose no jail time**, favoring an unconditional discharge with no punishment during sentencing on Jan. 10. The conviction stems from a hush-money payment cover-up during Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign, making him the first president-elect to enter office as a felon. Trump, meanwhile, asked to delay his sentencing, arguing it violates presidential immunity and disrupts his transition to the White House. Judge Juan Merchan, [however](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-seeks-stay-sentencing-hush-money-case-rcna186373), denied Trump‚Äôs request to delay his sentence.

* **üß© What‚Äôs at stake?** At stake is the principle that no one is above the law, even a president-elect. This case tests the boundaries of presidential immunity and the ability of the legal system to hold powerful political figures accountable. Trump‚Äôs arguments raise critical questions about how far immunity protections extend and whether they apply to personal conduct unrelated to official duties. Allowing immunity claims to stall accountability risks undermining public confidence in the justice system.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Notables.

1. **Biden announced a permanent ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling across 625 million acres of U.S. waters**, citing environmental risks and the need to protect coastal economies and ecosystems. The ban applies to the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and parts of Alaska's Bering Sea, invoking the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to limit future reversals. While environmentalists praised the move as critical for climate action, industry groups and President-elect Trump, who vowed to repeal the ban, criticized it as harmful to energy production.

2. **Trump vowed to reverse Biden‚Äôs ban on offshore oil and gas drilling**, calling the policy ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù and pledging to undo it immediately after taking office, though doing so may require congressional action. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/06/congress/donald-trump-drilling-ban-00196667))

3. **Biden signed the Social Security Fairness Act, eliminating provisions that reduced benefits for public service retirees, such as teachers and firefighters, increasing payments for nearly 3 million people**. The changes address long-standing inequities but add strain to the Social Security Trust Fund, potentially accelerating its insolvency date. While advocates hail the law as a victory for fairness, critics warn of its financial implications for Social Security‚Äôs future. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/higher-social-security-payments-coming-millions-people-bill-117343285))

4. **Biden awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation‚Äôs highest civilian honor, to 19 recipients, including Hillary Clinton, Denzel Washington, Bono, and posthumously, activist Fannie Lou Hamer, in recognition of their contributions to society**. Other honorees included Magic Johnson, Jane Goodall, and Jos√© Andr√©s, highlighting achievements in areas such as civil rights, conservation, and humanitarian work.

5. **Ann Telnaes, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist for The Washington Post, resigned after the paper's editorial section rejected her cartoon criticizing billionaires, including Jeff Bezos, for supporting Trump**. Telnaes called the decision a threat to press freedom, while the editorial page editor, David Shipley, defended the move as an editorial judgment to avoid repetition. The incident sparked criticism from other cartoonists, who called the rejection a failure to uphold editorial independence.

6. **A federal judge found Rudy Giuliani in contempt of court for failing to comply with orders to disclose his assets in a $146 million defamation judgment awarded to Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea ‚ÄúShaye‚Äù Moss**. The judgment stemmed from Giuliani‚Äôs false claims about election fraud that led to harassment and threats against the plaintiffs. Judge Lewis Liman criticized Giuliani for stalling and said sanctions would be determined later. Giuliani cited legal burdens and missing documents as reasons for noncompliance, while Freeman and Moss‚Äôs attorneys accused him of willful defiance.

7. **Trump will inherit an economy and nation in strong condition by many metrics, including low unemployment, declining crime rates, and a growing economy, despite his characterization of the U.S. as being in crisis**. While economic fundamentals are robust, challenges remain, such as rising costs of living, political divisions, and public dissatisfaction. Trump‚Äôs ability to sustain or improve these conditions depends on navigating potential risks like inflation or trade conflicts while addressing issues that resonate with voters. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/05/us/politics/trump-us-disaster-numbers.html))

8. **Trump has invited various groups of House Republicans, including members of the Freedom Caucus and key committee chairs, to Mar-a-Lago next weekend to unify support for his legislative agenda before his inauguration**. The meetings come after a tense speaker vote and aim to ensure cohesion within the GOP's narrow House majority as Republicans prepare to advance significant policies, including extending Trump‚Äôs 2017 tax law. Trump‚Äôs team coordinated closely with Speaker Mike Johnson to organize the gatherings. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-invites-house-republicans-mar-lago-rcna186296))

9. **Mike Johnson was reelected as House Speaker after overcoming a brief revolt from three Republican members**, solidifying his position with Trump‚Äôs backing and new rules limiting motions to vacate. The new rules package raises the threshold for ousting the Speaker, eliminates the House Diversity and Inclusion office, and emphasizes conservative priorities, such as border security and voting laws. Johnson‚Äôs narrow victory and the concessions he made highlight ongoing GOP divisions, foreshadowing potential challenges in advancing Trump‚Äôs legislative agenda.
