1/ **The House rejected the Trump-endorsed plan to fund the government and avert a shutdown** after 38 Republicans joined 197 Democrats in voting against the alternative funding bill. The package — which included funding the government through March 14, suspending the debt ceiling until 2027, and disaster relief — was quickly put together Thursday afternoon after Trump and Musk urged Republicans to kill the bipartisan package. Government funding expires at the end of the day on Friday.

2/ **With less than 12 hours left before a shutdown, Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans plan to break up their previously agreed to bipartisan funding bill into three separate votes**: government funding, disaster aid, and a farm bill extension. Trump’s demand to address the debt ceiling would not receive a vote. Johnson reportedly wants to try to pass that plan through the Rules Committee, which would need a simple majority to pass, but also require a lot of Democratic support. Separately, Johnson is also pursuing a second option that largely matches the Trump-endorsed package that failed in the House yesterday, except it wouldn't include raising the debt limit. Senators said “the House needs to do its job” and “sort it themselves.” The White House, meanwhile, moved ahead with shutdown preparations, notifying federal workers they might be furloughed.

3/ **After blowing up the bipartisan funding bill at the 11th hour, Trump said any government shutdown “is a Biden problem to solve.”** He added: “If there is going to be a shutdown of government, let it begin now." Elon Musk, meanwhile, said “Either the government should pass sensible bills that actually serve the people or shut it down!” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/20/trump-shutdown-biden-problem-00195574) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/us/politics/trump-blame-shutdown.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-government-shutdown-deadline-speaker-johnson-budget-da117337aa0c0adab34a5626bb5816af) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-20/house-may-vote-on-temporary-fix-to-stop-shutdown-networks-say))

4/ **Elon Musk publicly endorsed the Alternative for Germany, a far-right, anti-immigration party that’s promoted neo-Nazi rhetoric**, saying "Only the AfD can save Germany.” Musk’s post was in response to a 24-year-old German far-right influencer criticizing the leading candidate to become Germany’s next chancellor. The AfD is polling in second place at 19%.
