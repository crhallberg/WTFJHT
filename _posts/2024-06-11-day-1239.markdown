1/ **Judge Aileen Cannon denied convicted felon Trump‚Äôs effort to dismiss his classified documents case, but did agree to delete a paragraph in the federal superseding indictment** that alleges he mishandled classified materials after he left the White House and obstructed attempts to retrieve them. Cannon said that special counsel Jack Smith's inclusion of a paragraph, which alleges Trump showed a classified document in September 2021 about an ‚Äúongoing military operation‚Äù was ‚Äúnot going well" to someone without a security clearance, was ‚Äúnot appropriate,‚Äù because it‚Äôs not directly related to the charges Trump is facing. Trump isn‚Äôt charged with disclosing classified materials; only with illegally retaining them.

2/ **Attorney General Merrick Garland called the attacks on the Justice Department by Trump and his allies "baseless, personal and dangerous."** For the [second time this month](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/06/04/day-1232/#3-attorney-general-merrick-garland-c) Garland has publicly pushed back against threats by House Republicans to defund special counsel Jack Smith ‚Äì who is prosecuting Trump for attempting to overturn the 2020 election and illegally retaining classified documents and obstructing efforts to retrieve them ‚Äì as well as conspiracy theories that the Justice Department was involved in the Manhattan District Attorney‚Äôs prosecution of Trump. Garland said the department was facing threats of violence ‚Äúlike never before,‚Äù adding that the "continued unfounded attacks against the Justice Department's employees are dangerous for people's safety. They are dangerous for our democracy. This must stop." Meanwhile in a letter to House Republicans, the Justice Department said it had found no emails between DOJ leadership and District Attorney Alvin Bragg‚Äôs office about any Trump case, calling it ‚Äúconspiratorial speculation.‚Äù ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/11/merrick-garland-justice-department-attacks-washington-post) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/11/merrick-garland-doj-attacks-00162674) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manhattan-da-bragg-secured-trump-conviction-testify-gop-led-judiciary-rcna156567) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-contacts-senior-officials-manhattan-da-bragg-trump/story?id=111017619) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/06/11/congress/doj-letter-house-judiciary-trump-manhattan-da-bragg-00162672))

3/ **House Democrats launched a task force to prepare for the so-called Project 2025**, a 920-page policy blueprint compiled by the far-right Heritage Foundation for how a second Trump administration could expand the power of the presidency to act unilaterally while dismantling layers of the federal government. At its core, Project 2025 proposes purging thousands of civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists. ‚ÄúThis stuff is going to be coming at us at lightspeed. And if we are on our heels and reacting to it, we could lose our democracy," Jared Huffman said, one of the lawmakers spearheading The Stop Project 2025 Task Force. "So we're going to need to be ready to confront it in real time. And those plans need to begin now." Huffman added: ‚ÄúThe stakes just couldn‚Äôt be higher.‚Äù ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/06/11/congress/new-democratic-trump-task-force-huffman-house-00162560) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/project-2025-trump-biden-election-congress-6899a1167a4522b1c8be371f7abe7ee9) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/11/house-democrats-project-2025-task-force) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-democrats-project-2025-task-force-trump_n_66672287e4b0889986ac57cf) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/11/trump-project-2025-wrecking-ball))

* **In Trump‚Äôs orbit, some muse about mandatory military service**. "Only 1 percent of the U.S. population serves in the armed forces. Some in the former president‚Äôs camp say it‚Äôs time more young adults put 'some skin in the game.‚Äô" ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/06/10/trump-military-draft-mandatory-service/))

4/ **A federal judge ruled that Florida could not prohibit transgender minors from receiving gender-affirming care**. Judge Robert Hinkle said the state's policies were "unconstitutional" because ‚Äúgender identity is real‚Äù and that a ‚Äúwidely accepted standard of care‚Äù includes puberty blockers and hormone treatments. Hinkle added that "transgender opponents are of course free to hold their beliefs, but they are not free to discriminate against transgender individuals just for being transgender."

* **üìå [Day 806](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/04/05/day-806/#6-the-florida-senate-passed-a-plan-t): The Florida Senate passed a plan that would ban gender-affirming care for children diagnosed with gender dysphoria**. The bill, SB 254, prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from undergoing surgeries or hormone therapies associated with gender-affirming care. The legislation comes after the Florida Board of Medicine and the Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine ‚Äì at the urging of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ‚Äì¬†adopted rules that barred all doctors from treating minors with the surgeries and prescription treatments in November. Those rules went into effect last month. Florida is one of 13 states that have enacted bans on transgender care.

5/ **Hunter Biden was found guilty on three counts related to his illegal purchase of a handgun when he was using narcotics**. Hunter Biden, a private citizen who has never sought elective office or been part of a presidential administration, is the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of a crime. He faces up to 25 years in prison. The charges were brought by special counsel David Weiss, who was appointed by Trump, after a plea deal [fell apart](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/07/26/day-918/#2-hunter-biden-pleaded-not-guilty-to) in the courtroom last July. Weiss said he brought the case because nobody ‚Äúis above the law.‚Äù Trump ‚Äì who has continued to falsely claim his conviction on 34 felony counts of election interference involving falsified business records to conceal a hush money payment to a porn star was ‚Äúrigged‚Äù and that ‚Äúthis is all done by Biden and his people‚Äù ‚Äì [baselessly suggested without evidence](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/11/trump-campaign-hunter-biden-reaction-00162726) that Hunter Biden‚Äôs guilty verdict was a ‚Äúdistraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family." Joe Biden, [meanwhile](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/11/joe-biden-respect-the-judicial-process-as-hunter-considers-appeal.html), said he will "respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal." Earlier this month, Biden said he would not pardon his son.
