1/ **Attorney General Merrick Garland formally prohibited the seizure of reporters' records.** Reversing years of department policy, Garland formally prohibited federal prosecutors from seizing the records of journalists in leak investigations, with limited exceptions.

2/ **The U.S. formally accused China of hacking Microsoft**. The Biden administration is also organizing a broad group of allies to condemn Beijing for cyberattacks around the world, but will stop short of taking concrete punitive steps.

3/ **One of the U.S. Capitol rioters was convicted of a felony and sentenced to 8 months in prison**. Paul Hodgkins, a 38-year-old Floridian, is now the first Capitol rioter convicted of a felony to be sentenced. He pleaded guilty to breaching the Senate chamber during the U.S. Capitol insurrection and was sentenced on Monday in a closely watched case that could influence how hundreds of other rioters charged with the same felony are punished.

4/ **The Biden Administration transferred its first detainee from Guantánamo Bay and repatriated him to Morocco**. The Biden team picked up where the Obama administration left off with the repatriation of a Moroccan man, reducing the island prison's population to 39.

5/ **The Department of Justice says it won't prosecute ex-Trump Commerce chief Wilbur Ross for misleading Congress on a Census question about citizenship status**. Ross "misrepresented the full rationale for the reinstatement of the citizenship question" during appearances before House committees in 2018, the Commerce Department inspector general found.

6/ **Trump’s business made $2.4 billion during the four years he served as president**. Forbes estimates the pandemic helped wipe about $200 million off Trump’s top line last year.
