1/ **The Manhattan DA's office agreed to delay the start of the hush money case against Trump by 30 days.** "Specifically, yesterday the USAO produced approximately 31,000 pages of additional records and represented that there will be another production of documents by next week," the DA's office wrote in a motion to the court. The newly disclosed evidence relates to Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty and served time for various offenses in a separate case in 2018. Trump's defense attorneys had sought a longer postponement of up to 90 days and have asked the judge to sanction the DA's office over the late disclosure of documents, claiming that the DA's office engaged in "widespread misconduct" to improve their position in the potential trial. The trial was initially set to begin with jury selection on March 25.

2/ **A federal judge in Florida rejected a motion to dismiss Trump's classified documents case.** In a brief written order, U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon said some of Trump's arguments merit "serious consideration," but she also noted that dismissing charges at this stage over definitional disputes of the terms in the Espionage Act would be premature. Cannon also expressed skepticism towards the defense's argument based on the Presidential Records Act. Trump's lawyers highlighted the lack of prosecution against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server, despite the FBI finding no classified material in her emails. Trump and his co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, have pleaded not guilty to all 40 criminal charges related to the alleged mishandling of classified documents.

* **A federal appeals court unanimously rejected former Trump adviser Peter Navarro's attempt to avoid prison while appealing his contempt of Congress conviction** for defying a Jan. 6 committee subpoena. Navarro, 74, must report to a Miami facility by March 19 to serve a four-month sentence, becoming the first former Trump adviser jailed for actions related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

3/ **Chuck Schumer criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a speech on the Senate floor and called for new elections in Israel.** Schumer cited Netanyahu's prioritization of political survival over Israel's best interests in the wake of Hamas' attack and the ongoing bombardment of Gaza. Schumer, the highest-ranking elected Jewish official in the U.S., emphasized the need for change and a negotiated two-state solution, while also calling for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to step down.

4/ **The Biden administration imposed unprecedented sanctions on two Israeli settler outposts and three individuals in the West Bank due to violence against Palestinians.** The move comes amid increased tensions between the Netanyahu government and the U.S. over the ongoing settler violence and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Israeli forces have killed more than 31,000 people. The sanctions block access to U.S. assets or property and prohibit banks from working with the targets of the sanctions.

5/ **An American company that paid indicted FBI informant Alexander Smirnov $600,000 in 2020 has ties to a UK firm owned by Trump business associates in Dubai.** Smirnov was accused of lying to the FBI about the Bidens' involvement in a bribery scheme with Ukrainian company Burisma and provided false accounts that Republicans used to justify a House impeachment investigation. The CEO of the American company, ETT, along with a Pakistani American investor and a former Damac Properties chairman linked to Trump, registered the related UK company in March 2020. The connections raise questions about the motivations behind Smirnov's fabricated allegations and their potential political implications.
