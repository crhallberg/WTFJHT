1/ **Biden promised to end hunger in the U.S. by the end of the decade**, unveiling $8 billion in public- and private-sector commitments to make food healthier, more affordable, and accessible. It was the first White House summit dedicated to combating hunger in nearly a half-century. “I know we can do this,” Biden said. “This goal is within our reach." Most of the policy proposals – like permanently extending the child tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and expanding nutrition assistance programs – will require congressional approval.

2/ **The Congressional Budget Office reported that the poorest half of Americans – about 150 million people – hold 2% of the nation’s wealth**. The top 10% of American families, meanwhile, account for 72% of the nation's wealth. In 1989, the bottom half of the population held 4% of total wealth while the top 10 held 64%. "This report confirms what we already know: The very rich are getting much, much richer while the middle class is falling further and further behind, and being forced to take on outrageous levels of debt," Bernie Sanders said. "The obscene level of income and wealth inequality in America is a profoundly moral issue that we cannot continue to ignore or sweep under the rug."

3/ **Biden warned that Social Security and Medicare are "on the chopping block" if Republicans regained control of Congress**. Some Republicans have called for restructuring or scaling back entitlement programs with Rick Scott going so far as to draft a plan that would "sunset" Social Security and Medicare if Congress doesn't act. Social Security's combined reserves, meanwhile, are [projected](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/06/02/day-499/#6-social-security-is-projected-to-be) to be depleted in 2035. After that, the program will be able to pay about 77% of the scheduled benefits unless Congress steps in. Roughly 56 million people received retirement and survivors benefits in 2021.

4/ **The European Union proposed new sanctions in response to Russia escalating its war in Ukraine by drafting at least 300,000 men into its army, threatening the use of nuclear weapons, and holding "sham" referendums**. European leaders also vowed a “robust and united response” to the "[sabotage](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2022/09/27/day-616/#6-european-leaders-blamed-the-kremli)" of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. The White House, meanwhile, said that Russia's attempts to annex four Ukrainian regions under its control were “illegitimate” and “outrageous.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, “The Russian government falsified the results to advance the lie that the Ukrainian people want to be part of Russia.” The Biden administration also announced $1.1 billion in additional security assistance for Ukraine, bringing the total U.S. commitment to more than $16.2 billion.

5/ **Mitch McConnell endorsed a bipartisan electoral count reform bill in the Senate**, which now has the public support from 11 Republican senators – enough to overcome the chamber’s 60-vote filibuster threshold. The legislation aims to stop future presidents from trying to overturn election results through Congress by raising the threshold for lawmakers to object to the electoral count and reaffirm that the vice president only has a ministerial role in the count of electoral votes. The House passed its own version last week. Prior to McConnell's endorsement, the Senate Rules Committee voted to advance the bill. Ted Cruz was the lone senator to vote against the bill.
