Paul Alexander ‚Äì then the scientific adviser to Health and Human Services spokesperson Michael Caputo¬†‚Äì sent an Aug. 8 email to Redfield demanding that the CDC‚Äôs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports be changed to match Trump‚Äôs rhetoric downplaying the virus. Alexander also accused career scientists of trying to subvert Trump's reelection bid. Redfield instructed staff to delete the email. HHS Secretary Alex Azar, meanwhile, said that instructing staff to delete documents is unethical and possibly a violation of federal record-keeping requirements.

5/ **Mitch McConnell told House and Senate leadership that Senate Republicans would not support a $908 billion bipartisan coronavirus relief proposal**. Senate Republicans have taken exception to the group‚Äôs proposal to combine $160 billion in state and local aid with a temporary liability shield for businesses. It's unclear what kind of package both the GOP-controlled Senate and Democratic-held House could support.  Senate, meanwhile, must pass a spending bill ‚Äì¬†and have Trump sign it ‚Äì by Friday night to avert a government shutdown.

([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/10/pandemic-shoplifting-hunger/))

6/ **All 50 states and the District of Columbia certified their presidential results**. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, however, announced that he would hold a hearing on election ‚Äúirregularities‚Äù on Dec. 16 ‚Äî two days after the electoral college casts its votes. Biden is projected to win 306 electoral votes, while Trump is projected to win 232. Chuck Schumer called on Republicans to drop plans for the "ridiculous" hearing, asking ‚ÄúWhen is this nonsense detrimental to our democracy going to end?‚Äù ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/09/politics/2020-election-results-certified/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-republicans-biden-election/2020/12/09/abd596ea-3a4e-11eb-9276-ae0ca72729be_story.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/10/schumer-johnson-gop-cancel-election-hearing-444283))

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the lawsuit Tuesday asking the Supreme Court to invalidate the ballots of millions of voters in the four battleground states despite no evidence of widespread fraud. Pennsylvania called the lawsuit a "seditious abuse of the judicial process," and Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr called the lawsuit an "attack on Georgia‚Äôs sovereignty" that should be dismissed outright because it is ‚Äúconstitutionally, legally and factually wrong.‚Äù Trump, meanwhile, warned Carr not to rally other Republican officials against the Texas lawsuit in a 15-minute phone call.  Earlier Wednesday, Trump asked the Supreme Court to let him join the Texas lawsuit challenging the election results and  met with several state attorneys general that are backing the legal challenge at the White House.
