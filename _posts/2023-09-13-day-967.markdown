1/ **Inflation accelerated for a second consecutive month – the fastest pace in more than a year** – due to a jump in gasoline prices, which accounted for more than half of the increase. Consumer prices rose 0.6% in August from the prior month – the most since inflation peaked at a four-decade high in June 2022 – and up 3.7% from a year earlier. Although prices climbed at a faster monthly pace than expected,  the report keeps Federal Reserve officials on track to hold interest rates steady next week after raising rates to a 22-year high in July. The Fed has two more meetings this year – in early November and mid-December – and their decision on whether to lift rates higher will depend on whether price increases continue to slow in coming months.

2/ **A federal judge denied Mark Meadows’ request to pause court proceedings in Fulton County while he appeals the ruling**. Last week, U.S. District Judge Steve Jones rejected Meadows’ request to move his case to federal court. Meadows “has not shown he is entitled to an emergency stay,” Jones ruled, adding: “Meadows’s contentions that he would be irreparably harmed by the possibility of facing trial next month are insufficient to carry his burden on the emergency stay requested." Meadows, meanwhile, appealed the decision to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted him an expedited review.

3/ **A federal judge refused to give Trump permission to discuss classified documents at Mar-a-Lago**, where he's already mishandled classified documents. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, however, didn't specify where the secure facility for reviewing sensitive records for Trump's trial will be. Trump's lawyers argued that requiring him to travel to talk about classified information would impose a heavy burden, given the complex logistics and security involved as both a former president and 2024 candidate. Prosecutors, however, told Cannon that Trump was seeking “special treatment that no other criminal defendant would receive.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/09/13/trump-classified-scif-mar-a-lago-cannon/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/13/us/politics/cannon-trump-scif-secret-documents.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/13/politics/trump-classified-documents-mar-a-lago-scif/index.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/13/judge-sets-limits-on-trump-discussing-classified-info-in-mar-a-lago-documents-case.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-13/trump-rebuffed-from-discussing-mar-a-lago-evidence-at-mar-a-lago?sref=MIBMEEoj)) 

4/ **Trump privately discussed impeaching Biden with House Republicans**. Trump has been briefed weekly by Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, on the impeachment strategy, as well as regularly talked with members of the House Freedom Caucus and other Republicans who've pushed for the inquiry. Two nights before Kevin McCarthy announced the impeachment inquiry, Trump had dinner with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has introduced articles of impeachment against Biden.

5/ **Mitt Romney will not seek re-election, saying it's time for a “new generation of leaders” beyond Trump and Biden**. Romney, 76, noted that he would be in his mid-80s by the end of another term and that it's time for a new generation to “step up” and “shape the world they’re going to live in." Romney is the only Republican to vote to convict Trump in both of his impeachment trials.
