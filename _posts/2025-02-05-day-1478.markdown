1/ **Trump proposed that the U.S. "take over" and have a ‚Äúlong-term ownership position‚Äù over Gaza, relocate the Palestinian population to a ‚Äúgood, fresh, beautiful piece of land‚Äù in another country, and redevelop the territory under U.S. control**. Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump described Gaza as a ‚Äúdemolition site‚Äù and suggested turning it into the ‚ÄúRiviera of the Middle East.‚Äù Trump, however, didn‚Äôt specify how the U.S. would acquire or govern the land, but suggested that American troops could be deployed ‚Äúif necessary.‚Äù Later, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, attempted to walk back parts of the proposal, saying Trump "has not committed to putting boots on the ground in Gaza‚Äù and that the U.S. will not pay for rebuilding in Gaza. Leavitt also didn‚Äôt clarify how the U.S. could take control of Gaza without using military force, but claimed Trump "is the best dealmaker on the planet‚Äù and said Palestinians in Gaza need to be ‚Äútemporarily relocated.‚Äù Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan, however, expressed an ‚Äúunequivocal rejection‚Äù of any attempts to displace Palestinians. Legal experts, meanwhile, warn that Trump‚Äôs proposal to relocate Gaza‚Äôs Palestinian population and take U.S. control of the territory would constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity under international law. Forced population transfers are explicitly prohibited by the Geneva Conventions, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and other legal frameworks dating back to the U.S. Civil War. Netanyahu welcomed Trump‚Äôs approach, while Palestinian leaders and Hamas condemned it as an attempt at ethnic cleansing.

2/ **Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove accused FBI leadership of "insubordination" for refusing to identify a "core team" of agents involved in Jan. 6 investigations**. Bove added that rank-and-file agents "who simply followed orders and carried out their duties in an ethical manner‚Äù would not be fired unless they ‚Äúacted with corrupt or partisan intent.‚Äù The Justice Department, meanwhile, requested data on over 5,000 FBI employees involved in the investigations after the bureau's acting leadership declined to provide a narrower list. FBI officials said the request could lead to mass firings, while lawsuits were filed to block the release of agent details.

3/ **The CIA offered so-called "buyouts" to the entire workforce**. Employees were given the option to resign while receiving eight months of pay and benefits, though some critical roles were excluded. CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended the "deferred resignation" program as a strategy to ‚Äúinfuse the agency with renewed energy,‚Äù encourage long-tenured officers to retire early, and align the workforce with national security priorities like China and drug cartels. The CIA, meanwhile, sent the White House an unclassified email listing first names and initials of employees hired in the past two years to comply. The list includes probationary hires, many focused on China, making them potential targets for foreign intelligence services. Former officials criticized the move as a ‚Äúcounterintelligence disaster,‚Äù warning that adversaries could use other data to identify employees.

4/ **A federal judge issued a nationwide injunction blocking Trump‚Äôs executive order to end birthright citizenship**. Judge Deborah Boardman ruled that the order ruling that it "conflicts with the plain language of the 14th Amendment, contradicts 125-year-old binding Supreme Court precedent, and runs counter to our nation‚Äôs 250-year history of citizenship by birth." The ruling follows a previous temporary block by a judge in Seattle.

### üßê WTF is Elon Musk doing? An incomplete recap. 

**Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency has moved quickly to take control of key federal systems, pushing government employees out, dismantling USAID, and accessing sensitive data**. The effort has triggered lawsuits, congressional scrutiny, and concerns about disruptions to Social Security, Medicare, and foreign aid.

DOGE operatives working at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have accessed payment and contracting systems to flag what they consider fraud. CMS manages $1.5 trillion in annual spending. DOGE also accessed systems that track government contracts, but not those containing personal health records or the Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System, which processes payments.

The Treasury Department granted DOGE ‚Äúread-only‚Äù access to the federal payment system, which handles $6 trillion a year, including Social Security and Medicare payments. Although no payments have been blocked, critics warn Musk‚Äôs team could disrupt or cut funding for programs like Medicaid and disability benefits. Sen. Elizabeth Warren called DOGE‚Äôs role ‚Äúextraordinarily dangerous,‚Äù while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended it as an effort to ‚Äúmaximize payment integrity.‚Äù A 25-year-old engineer currently has permissions that allow him to modify critical payment infrastructure.

The Trump administration also removed nearly all USAID workers, shutting down major aid programs, including security assistance for Ukraine, clean water projects, and education initiatives. Employees were ordered to leave within 30 days, while contractors were fired immediately. Musk posted on X, ‚ÄúSpent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper.‚Äù The American Foreign Service Association is preparing legal action, arguing USAID cannot be shut down without congressional approval.

DOGE has also pushed federal employees to resign under a legally dubious ‚Äúdeferred resignation‚Äù plan, letting them quit while receiving pay through September. Over 20,000 have accepted. 

DOGE operatives have also accessed federal databases, including student loan records at the Education Department and NOAA‚Äôs IT systems. They‚Äôve also installed an unauthorized email server at the Office of Personnel Management to collect federal employee data, prompting a class-action lawsuit over data privacy violations. Musk ordered DOGE employees to stop using Slack, shifting records to a system not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests to limit public oversight.

Despite Musk‚Äôs authority, Trump aides have reminded him he still reports to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. While Musk maintains broad influence, Trump reportedly remains in control, saying: ‚ÄúElon can‚Äôt do and won‚Äôt do anything without our approval. Sometimes we won‚Äôt agree with it, and we‚Äôll not go where he wants to go.‚Äù
