1/ **A group of historians warned Biden that the current moment in America is among the most dangerous to democracy in modern history**, comparing the threat to democracy to the pre-Civil War era and to pro-fascist movements before World War II. The group of scholars focused on the rise of totalitarianism around the world and the threat to American democracy.

2/ **Attorney General Merrick Garland "personally approved the decision to seek a search warrant" for Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and asked a Florida judge to unseal the warrant**. Garland said he filed the motion to unseal both the warrant and the receipt that lists the items seized, citing the “substantial public interest” in the matter. Garland said the Justice Department "does not take such actions lightly" and first pursues "less intrusive" means to retrieve material, referring to the grand jury [subpoena](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/us/politics/trump-fbi-subpoena.html) Trump [received](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/mar-a-lago-search-subpoena-latest/) this spring for classified documents he improperly took to Mar-a-Lago when he left the White House. Investigators reportedly believed that the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago were so sensitive and related to national security that the Justice Department had to act.
