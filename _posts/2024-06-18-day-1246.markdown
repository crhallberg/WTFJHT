1/ **Biden announced executive actions to protect some 500,000 immigrants without legal status in the U.S. from deportation**. The new policy will shield undocumented individuals if they‚Äôve lived in the U.S. for 10 or more years and are married to a U.S. citizen. The protection also provides a streamlined path to citizenship. About 500,000 undocumented spouses and 50,000 undocumented stepchildren of U.S. citizens are expected to be eligible to apply. Biden also announced a policy that makes DACA recipients and so-called "Dreamers" eligible for work visas, rather than temporary work authorization. "Today's a good day," Biden said.

2/ **The New York Court of Appeals rejected convicted felon Trump's appeal of the gag order in the election interference case involving falsified business records**, in which he was convicted last month. The court wrote that Trump‚Äôs appeal was dismissed because ‚Äúno substantial constitutional question is directly involved.‚Äù As a result, Trump‚Äôs gag order, which bars him from speaking about jurors, witnesses and other parties involved in the Manhattan Supreme Court case, remains in effect. After Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts, his lawyers argued that the order should be lifted because the trial was over.

3/ **The House Ethics Committee is expanding its investigation into Matt Gaetz amid allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use**. The bipartisan committee said its investigation was paused in deference to the Justice Department‚Äôs investigation, but reopened it after the DOJ declined to bring charges. "There has been a significant and unusual amount of public reporting on the Committee's activities this Congress. Much of that reporting has been inaccurate," the committee said. The investigation is reportedly focused on whether Gaetz "engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct." So far, the comittee has conducted more than a dozen interviews, issued 25 subpoenas, and received thousands of pages of documents.

* **üìå [Day 71](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/03/31/day-71/#10-the-justice-department-is-investi): The Justice Department is investigating whether Rep. Matt Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and violated federal sex trafficking laws by paying her to travel with him**. Attorney General William Barr opened the investigation in the final months of the Trump administration. Trump and several senior Justice Department officials were notified of the investigation. Gaetz called the investigation part of a scheme involving ‚Äúfalse sex allegations‚Äù to extort his family for $25 million, adding that he and his father, Don Gaetz, have been cooperating with the FBI by ‚Äúwearing a wire.‚Äù Gaetz, meanwhile, has privately told confidants that he's considering not seeking re-election and possibly leaving Congress early for a job at Newsmax.

* **üìå [Day 135](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/06/03/day-135/#7-the-justice-department-is-investig): The Justice Department is investigating whether Rep. Matt Gaetz obstructed justice when he called a witness in a potential sex crimes investigation**. The obstruction probe stems from an inquiry about whether Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and paid for her travels with him. The witness is one of the women allegedly connected to Gaetz through his "wingman" Joel Greenberg, a Florida tax collector who pleaded guilty to several crimes, including the sex-trafficking of a 17-year-old girl in 2017. While Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing, including obstructing justice or having sex with the trafficked 17-year-old, Greenberg struck a [plea deal](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/joel-greenberg/os-ne-joel-greenberg-sentencing-set-matt-gaetz-ally-20210603-tmixg4vv4vb77frnof64zgx6m4-story.html) with prosecutors last month and is [cooperating](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/05/13/day-114/#3-a-florida-politician-%E2%80%93-and-rep-mat) with authorities in the investigation.

* **üìå [Day 757](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/02/15/day-757/#4-the-justice-department-closed-its): The Justice Department closed its sex trafficking investigation into Matt Gaetz and will not charge the congressman**. Federal prosecutors and the FBI began investigating Gaetz in 2020 over allegations that the congressman had violated federal law by paying for sex, including sex with a minor that he transported across state lines to engage in prostitution. Gaetz‚Äôs close friend, Joel Greenberg, pleaded guilty in 2021 to six federal crimes, including sex trafficking involving a person under 18 years old, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Greenberg was sentenced to 11 years in prison.
