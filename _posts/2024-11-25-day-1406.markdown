1/ **Special counsel Jack Smith dropped all federal charges against Trump**, citing the Justice Department‚Äôs longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president. "That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government‚Äôs proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind," Smith wrote in his six-page motion seeking to dismiss the case without prejudice. "The Government‚Äôs position on the merits of the defendant‚Äôs prosecution has not changed. But the circumstances have." In both cases, Smith requested that the dismissals be ‚Äúwithout prejudice,‚Äù meaning prosecutors could decide to charge Trump again after he leaves office in January 2029. [Trump was first indicted in June 2023](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/06/09/day-871/#1-the-justice-department-charged-tru) on 37 felony counts of unlawfully retaining classified documents after leaving office, making false statements, and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Trump was separately [indicted on four felonies in August 2023](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/08/01/day-924/#1-trump-was-indicted-by-special-coun) for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempting to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. Smith asked that the classified documents case against Trump's two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Olivera, be allowed to continue. Earlier this year, the judge ruled that Smith‚Äôs appointment was unconstitutional and dismissed the indictment. Smith‚Äôs office is appealing that decision.

* ### WTF Questions and Answers:

* **How does the Justice Department's policy affect legal cases against sitting presidents?** The Justice Department's policy bars prosecuting sitting presidents to avoid interference with their ability to govern. It ensures that legal matters do not obstruct constitutional responsibilities but can delay accountability until after a president‚Äôs term. This approach is intended to maintain institutional stability but raises concerns about fairness and the rule of law.

* **What are the charges Trump faced before the dismissal?** Trump faced 37 felony charges for retaining classified documents, making false statements, and obstructing justice. He also faced four felonies related to attempts to overturn the 2020 election, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and obstruct an official proceeding. These charges reflected significant legal and ethical violations.

* **Why were Trump‚Äôs charges dismissed "without prejudice"?** Dismissal "without prejudice" allows prosecutors to refile charges later, ensuring that accountability can still occur. The decision aligns with Justice Department policy protecting sitting presidents from prosecution. It reflects a balance between deferring action and preserving the right to pursue justice in the future.

* **What happens to Trump‚Äôs co-defendants in the classified documents case?** Walt Nauta and Carlos De Olivera, co-defendants in the classified documents case, will continue to face legal proceedings. Their cases were not dismissed, reflecting that prosecutorial focus on alleged criminal conduct surrounding Trump remains active for those not shielded by presidential immunity.

* **Why was Jack Smith‚Äôs appointment ruled unconstitutional?** A judge ruled Smith's appointment unconstitutional due to procedural concerns, potentially undermining his authority to bring charges. Smith's office is appealing this decision, as it could impact the broader legitimacy of prosecutions tied to his special counsel role. This issue highlights the legal complexities of special counsel appointments.

* **What are the broader implications of presidential immunity for future leaders?** Expanding presidential immunity could encourage future leaders to act without fear of legal consequences, potentially leading to abuses of power. This development raises concerns about the erosion of democratic checks and balances, affecting the ability of institutions to hold leaders accountable.

* **Trump‚Äôs hush money sentencing was postponed indefinitely as the judge weighs case dismissal bid**. Judge Juan Merchan indefinitely delayed Trump‚Äôs sentencing in the Manhattan hush money case to consider arguments for dismissing the case entirely, citing Trump‚Äôs status as president-elect. Trump‚Äôs legal team argues that sentencing or the case itself would create unconstitutional obstacles to his governance. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg opposes dismissing the case but has not objected to delaying sentencing, which might be postponed until after Trump‚Äôs presidency. [Trump was convicted](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/30/day-1227/#1-trump-a-former-u-s-president-and-t) in May of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/22/donald-trump-hush-money-sentencing-00191253))

2/ **Trump named Pam Bondi as his new choice for attorney general** after Matt Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for [attorney general](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/11/21/day-1402/#1-matt-gaetz-withdrew-his-name-from) following scrutiny over allegations of sex trafficking an underage girl and drug use that threatened his confirmation. Bondi has strongly criticized investigations and prosecutions involving Trump, including the 2016 Russia interference probe and his 2019 impeachment, labeling them illegitimate. Following Trump‚Äôs four criminal indictments, Bondi argued on Fox News that ‚Äúthe prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated.‚Äù Her remarks align with a broader narrative among Trump allies that frames these legal challenges as politically motivated. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/23/pam-bondi-doj-attorney-general-trump-pick/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/21/trump-attorney-general-gaetz-saga) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-announces-pam-bondi-attorney-general-pick-gaetz-withdraws-rcna181279))

* **üß© What's at stake?** At stake is the independence of the U.S. Justice Department, a cornerstone of democracy. If it becomes a political weapon, citizens risk losing protections against abuses of power, and accountability mechanisms for leaders could dissolve. Bondi‚Äôs confirmation would set a precedent for loyalty-based governance, paving the way for autocratic tendencies that challenge America‚Äôs democratic ideals and weaken institutional checks on executive power.

3/ **Matt Gaetz does not intend to join the 119th Congress after he resigned from the 118th Congress**. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still going to be in the fight, but it‚Äôs going to be from a new perch," Gaetz said. Soon after Gaetz joined Cameo, a platform for selling personalized video messages to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and retirements. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5004829-gaetz-house-congress-florida-trump-attorney-general/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/matt-gaetz-on-cameo-platform-rcna181565))

4/ **Despite repeatedly distancing himself from Project 2025, tapped Russell Vought to lead the White House budget office and "to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government."**  Vought, who served as the Office of Management and Budget director during Trump‚Äôs first term, wrote a chapter in Project 2025 on transforming the executive office, including detailing the executive orders and other unilateral actions that Trump could take during his first six months in office. Vought has also proposed eliminating the independence of some regulatory agencies that operate outside the direct control of the White House, as well as pushed to reclassify the federal workforce so Trump would have the authority to fire thousands of government employees who are currently considered civil servants. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/11/20/russ-vought-trump-white-house-budget-post/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/us/politics/russell-vought-office-of-management-and-budget.html) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-russ-vought-project-2025_n_6741248be4b078cce4af42b0))

5/ **Trump has refused to sign ethics pledges or agreements required by the Presidential Transitions Act**, allowing his transition team to accept secret donations and avoid mandated transparency. Trump has also missed key deadlines and failed to enable FBI background checks on nominees, prompting criticism from lawmakers who warned this undermines the administration's preparedness for national security and ethical governance. Historically, transitions have complied with agreements limiting donations and disclosing donors to prevent conflicts of interest and foreign influence, but Trump‚Äôs actions bypass these norms, raising accountability concerns. Trump is the first president-elect to bypass these restrictions. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/24/us/politics/donald-trump-2024-campaign-transition.html))

* **üí≠ Why does this matter?** Transparent funding in presidential transitions ensures public trust and accountability, preventing private interests from influencing critical government decisions. By refusing to disclose donors or adhere to established limits, Trump‚Äôs transition introduces a precedent of opacity, potentially encouraging future administrations to prioritize private gain over public service. This issue transcends partisanship, touching on ethical governance and the proper handover of power, which are foundational to a functioning democracy. Without oversight, foreign or corporate donors could gain undue influence, compromising the independence of the presidency and broader government operations.

6/ **Tulsi Gabbard, Trump‚Äôs nominee for Director of National Intelligence, was briefly placed on the TSA‚Äôs ‚ÄúQuiet Skies‚Äù list for additional screening due to flagged travel patterns and foreign connections**. The list, distinct from terrorist watchlists, prompted scrutiny because of Gabbard‚Äôs unorthodox foreign policy history, including a controversial 2017 trip to Syria to meet Bashar al-Assad. Republicans, meanwhile, defended Gabbard against Democrats‚Äô claims she is ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù due to her past meeting with al-Assad and controversial statements about Russia. Democrats expressed concerns about Gabbard‚Äôs foreign ties and questioned her judgment, citing risks to U.S. intelligence credibility with allies. Republicans, however, dismissed the claims as baseless, attributing them to political bias following Gabbard‚Äôs party switch. Senate hearings are expected to probe her controversial actions and statements. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/22/politics/tulsi-gabbard-government-watch-list-travel-connections/index.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/republicans-lash-democrats-claims-trump-intelligence-pick-gabbard-116181563))

### ‚úèÔ∏è Notables.

1. **Texas abortion ban linked to preventable miscarriage deaths as doctors avoid life-saving procedures**. Porsha Ngumezi, a 35-year-old mother, died after doctors delayed performing a standard D&C procedure during a miscarriage, opting for a less effective treatment due to fears of legal repercussions under Texas‚Äô strict abortion laws. Experts say abortion bans are pressuring doctors to avoid the standard of care even in clear medical emergencies, leading to preventable deaths. Porsha‚Äôs case reflects a growing trend in Texas, where healthcare providers hesitate to act on life-saving treatments amid confusion and fear over legal penalties. ([ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban))

2. **Patients rush for reproductive care ahead of Trump administration amid fears of restrictions**. As Trump prepares to take office, patients are seeking long-term contraception, emergency birth control, and abortion pills in record numbers, anticipating stricter reproductive health policies under his administration. Concerns include the potential rollback of ACA mandates, reduced access to Medicaid-covered contraception, and application of the Comstock Act to restrict abortion medication by mail. The surge mirrors past patterns during Trump‚Äôs presidency and the Dobbs decision, underscoring widespread uncertainty about the future of reproductive care in the U.S. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/25/trump-reproductive-care-patients-rush-abortion-pills))

3. **Illegal border crossings hit record low under Biden as Trump prepares stricter immigration measures**. Unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border are set to reach a Biden-era low in November, with fewer than 50,000 apprehensions expected, due in part to Mexico's enforcement efforts and Biden's stringent asylum policies. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/illegal-border-crossings-on-track-to-reach-biden-era-low/))

4. **Texas construction industry warns of economic fallout from Trump‚Äôs deportation pledge**. Trump‚Äôs vow to deport millions of undocumented immigrants raises alarm in Texas, where industries like construction heavily rely on undocumented workers, with nearly 60% of the sector‚Äôs workforce falling into this category. Industry leaders warn that mass deportations could devastate housing and infrastructure projects, exacerbate labor shortages, and harm the state‚Äôs booming economy. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/23/g-s1-35465/trump-deportation-migrants-immigrants-texas-construction-industry-border-security))

5. **Trump plans to reinstate transgender military ban**, potentially ejecting thousands of service members. Trump reportedly intends to sign an executive order upon his inauguration to ban transgender individuals from serving in the military, reversing Biden's policy and discharging approximately 15,000 current trans service members. Critics argue that this decision would exacerbate military recruitment challenges, disrupt unit cohesion, and impose financial and operational burdens. ([The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-transgender-military-policy-b2652956.html))

6. **Electric car sales could plunge if Trump eliminates federal tax credits**. Electric vehicle sales may drop by 27% if Trump and Congress repeal the $7,500 federal tax credit, which has been pivotal in making EVs more affordable. Industry experts warn that ending these incentives would raise prices, slow adoption, and harm investments in domestic manufacturing spurred by Biden‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/25/business/trump-electric-vehicle-tax-credit.html))

7. **California Gov. Gavin Newsom pledges California EV rebates if Trump ends federal tax credit**. California would revive its Clean Vehicle Rebate Program to offset the loss of federal EV tax credits if Trump's administration eliminates them. Newsom emphasized California's commitment to clean energy and affordable green transportation, aiming to maintain EV adoption despite potential federal rollbacks. The state previously provided incentives on over 590,000 vehicles and remains a national leader in environmental policies, often clashing with Trump‚Äôs administration on climate issues. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-electric-car-rebates-will-california-will-offer-rebates-rcna181626))

8. **Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized NPR as "Democrat propaganda,"** pledging to slash its funding as part of her role in the newly established "Department of Government Efficiency" subcommittee. NPR has previously faced Republican accusations of liberal bias, though federal funding comprises less than 1% of its revenue. Greene's efforts align with GOP calls to cut government spending and target public broadcasting, reflecting broader partisan divisions over media funding and ideological representation.

### üîç Dept. of Context and Consequence.

*News analysis and opinions on today‚Äôs key headlines ‚Äì why they matter and what‚Äôs at stake.*

1. **Voters rejected election reforms nationwide despite major advocacy push**. Efforts to reform U.S. elections through ranked choice voting and open primaries failed in most states, with voters in eight states rejecting ballot initiatives despite $110 million spent on advocacy. While small-scale successes were seen in some cities and regions, critics argued the reforms are confusing, lack grassroots support, and fail to significantly change election outcomes. Advocates plan to revise their approach, focusing on incremental changes and deeper public engagement to build momentum for future initiatives. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/ranked-choice-voting-open-primaries-election-reform-bc797f209e5f98a18afb2e5f784e63b6))

2. **Trump voters deny authoritarian intentions despite his extreme policy agenda**. Many Trump voters supported him for perceived economic benefits while denying or ignoring his authoritarian goals, discriminatory rhetoric, and controversial policies, such as mass deportations or severe abortion restrictions. This disconnect highlights the effectiveness of right-wing media in shaping perceptions and voters‚Äô tendency to rationalize or dismiss negative facts about Trump. As Trump pursues policies his base might not fully endorse, the broader implications for democracy remain uncertain, especially if economic gains continue to overshadow concerns about authoritarian governance. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/trump-promises-popularity/680730/))

3. **Lessons from Hungary: Resisting Trump‚Äôs autocratic agenda through strategic opposition**. Drawing from Viktor Orb√°n‚Äôs playbook, Trump aims to consolidate power through anti-elite rhetoric, economic nationalism, and institutional control, mirroring Hungary‚Äôs slide into autocracy. Effective resistance requires dismantling his populist narratives, rebuilding connections with the working class, and defending democratic institutions through grassroots mobilization, media pluralism, and left-populist economic policies. Hungary‚Äôs experience shows that protecting democracy means addressing tangible economic and social needs, not just abstract ideals. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/23/trump-autocrat-elections-00191281))

4. **Trump‚Äôs narrow 2024 win sparks exaggerated claims of a ‚Äúlandslide‚Äù mandate**. Trump secured one of the smallest popular-vote victories since the 19th century, winning by just 1.6 points and less than 50% of the vote, yet his campaign portrays the result as a ‚Äúlandslide‚Äù to amplify his perceived mandate. While Republicans gained Senate control, coattail effects were minimal, and his thin margins limit his ability to push through controversial policies. Analysts suggest his victory was more a rejection of Biden than a strong endorsement of Trump, raising questions about his capacity to unify Republicans behind his agenda. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/us/politics/trump-election-landslide.html))

5. **Trump‚Äôs narrow 2024 win forces Americans to confront his influence on democracy**. Despite ongoing controversies, legal convictions, and his contentious record, Trump‚Äôs return to office suggests a critical divide in voter priorities, with economic concerns outweighing fears for democratic integrity. The election reveals a reckoning with America‚Äôs political narrative, as Trump‚Äôs actions challenge long-standing institutional norms and the nation's historical commitment to democratic principles. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/good-country-bad-choice/680743/))
