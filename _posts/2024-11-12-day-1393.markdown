1/ **A New York judge postponed his decision on whether to dismiss Trump‚Äôs 34 felony convictions of orchestrating an illegal conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by falsifying business records**. Trump has argued that his return to the White House means the verdict should be set aside  because the Supreme Court granted immunity to presidents for all official acts in office. Trump‚Äôs lawyers asked to throw out the case, saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúnecessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump‚Äôs ability to govern.‚Äù  Prosecutors said they needed time to assess the ‚Äúunprecedented circumstances‚Äù of a convicted felon being elected president, including whether they want to keep the verdict intact and proceed with sentencing that is scheduled for Nov. 26. Justice Juan Merchan agreed to pause all proceedings until Nov. 19. The ruling is a win for Trump, the nation‚Äôs first former president to become a felon, and its first felon to become a president-elect.

2/ **The Supreme Court denied Mark Meadows‚Äô request to move his Georgia election interference case to federal court**. Meadows and Trump are among 19 people charged by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis with taking part in a scheme to violate state racketeering law. His lawyers argued that the case should be moved because he was acting as a ‚Äúfederal officer‚Äù at the time, but the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals turned away Meadows‚Äôs arguments, writing that the statute ‚Äúdoes not apply to former federal officers, and even if it did, the events giving rise to this criminal action were not related to Meadows‚Äôs official duties.‚Äù ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-12/ex-trump-aide-meadows-rejected-by-supreme-court-in-georgia-case) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/12/supreme-court-mark-meadows-georgia-election-interference/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-rejects-mark-meadows-appeal-georgia-election-interferenc-rcna178727) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/12/supreme-court-mark-meadows-trump-georgia-case) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4985671-supreme-court-mark-meadows-georgia/))

3/ **Trump appointed Mike Waltz as national security adviser, Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel, Lee Zeldin to lead the EPA, Kristi Noem as secretary of Homeland Security, Marco Rubio as secretary of state, and Steve Witkoff as special envoy to the Middle East**. Waltz, known for his outspoken stance against China, has previously supported prolonged U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. Huckabee, a strong supporter of Israel, has publicly condemned Hamas as incapable of honorable negotiation. Zeldin opposed Biden‚Äôs 2022 climate law, while Rubio, a prominent foreign policy hawk, has advocated for strict policies on China, Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba. Noem has faced scrutiny for recounting in a memoir that she once shot a family dog. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/12/us/trump-news-house-election) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-election-house-11-12-24/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/12/trump-administration-transition/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/trump-presidential-transition-november-11/?id=115744826) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/12/trump-kristi-noem-homeland-security-secretary) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/trump-rubio-secretary-of-state.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/11/mike-waltz-national-security-adviser-trump-cabinet/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/11/mike-waltz-national-security-adviser-trump-00188923) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-taps-lee-zeldin-lead-environmental-protection-agency-rcna179658) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/climate/trump-chooses-lee-zeldin-to-run-epa.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/kristi-noem-trump-cabinet-homeland-security-703f42e9) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/trump-appoint-lee-zeldin-epa-chief))

* **üí≠ Trump‚Äôs new appointments signal commitment to aggressive mass deportation policies**. With appointments of hardline immigration figures Tom Homan as "border czar" and Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff, Trump has reinforced his intent to execute strict immigration policies, including mass deportation and possible military involvement in enforcement. Miller‚Äôs detailed plans outline widespread deportations using broad federal authority, while Homan‚Äôs track record aligns him with enforcement-driven immigration policy. The exclusion of former officials with traditional conservative values like Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo further suggests Trump‚Äôs readiness to bypass conventional institutional norms in favor of uncompromising policy implementation. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/trump-staff-picks-stephen-miller-tom-homan/680629/))

* **Who‚Äôs in Trump‚Äôs new administration so far**: \
  Marco Rubio, Secretary of State \
  Mike Waltz, National Security Advisor \
  Kristi Noem, Homeland Security Secretary \
  Elise Stefanik, UN Ambassador \
  Tom Homan, "Border Czar" \
  Lee Zeldin, EPA Administrator \
  Susie Wiles, Chief of Staff \
  Stephen Miller, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy \
  Mike Huckabee, Ambassador to Israel \
  Steve Witkoff, Special Envoy to the Middle East

4/ **Trump‚Äôs team is weighing a draft executive order to create a ‚Äúwarrior board‚Äù of retired officers to review and remove three- and four-star generals based on ‚Äúleadership capability.‚Äù** If approved by Trump, the board would bypass traditional Pentagon review processes, allowing faster dismissals based on classifications ‚Äúlacking in requisite leadership qualities,‚Äù "strategic readiness," and "commitment to military excellence," but absent specific criteria. Critics warn this could politicize the military, including pressuring officers to align with administration views, given Trump‚Äôs past vow to fire ‚Äúwoke generals.‚Äù ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-draft-executive-order-would-create-board-to-purge-generals-7ebaa606))

* **üß© What's at stake?** The stakes are high for the principles of military neutrality and professional oversight that have guided U.S. defense policy for decades. Should the military‚Äôs highest ranks become politicized, it risks not only operational coherence but also its foundational values of duty and constitutional loyalty above partisan loyalty. The creation of this board may set a precedent that future administrations could expand upon, eroding the military's nonpartisan role in society and its commitment to serving the Constitution rather than a specific leader. This potential shift threatens the stability and integrity of one of the nation‚Äôs most trusted institutions, with long-term implications for democratic governance and civilian-military relations.

5/ **Democrat Ruben Gallego defeated Republican Kari Lake in Arizona‚Äôs U.S. Senate race**. Gallego becomes Arizona‚Äôs first Latino senator, replacing Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in 2022 and opted not to run. When Sinema won in 2018, she was the first Democrat from Arizona elected to the Senate in 30 years. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/arizona-senate-ruben-gallego-kari-lake-ea364326c93f9a8a32b7b9ca7ca696d4) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/12/g-s1-33813/arizona-senate-gallego-lake) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/12/arizona-senate-ruben-gallego-democrat-win) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/politics/ruben-gallego-kari-lake-arizona-senate.html))

6/ **Justice Samuel Alito intends to remain on the Supreme Court**, dismissing speculation that he might step down to allow Trump to appoint a younger conservative successor. With a conservative 6-3 majority, some Republicans had hoped Alito, 74, or Justice Clarence Thomas, 76, would retire, securing long-term conservative influence. Person close to Alito, however, said: ‚ÄúDespite what some people may think, this is a man who has never thought about this job from a political perspective. The idea that he‚Äôs going to retire for political considerations is not consistent with who he is.‚Äù Justice Sonia Sotomayor, 70, the Court's most senior liberal, also has no plans to retire, despite calls from some Democrats to consider stepping down while Democrats control the White House.

### üîç Dept. of Context and Consequence.

1. **Most Americans rely on friends, family, and the news media for 2024 election information, with notable divides across age, education, and political affiliation**. A survey from the Civic Health and Institutions Project reveals that Americans' primary sources of election information in 2024 are friends and family (29%) and the news media (26%), with significant variations by age, education, and political affiliation. Younger individuals and those with less education often turn to personal networks, while older and higher-income Americans prefer traditional media. Only a minority, 8%, cite local media as their main source, while 17% rely on national media, with Democrats more likely to use news media and Republicans favoring personal networks. Satisfaction with local political news is low, especially in rural areas, with higher satisfaction reported among urban residents, Black respondents, and Democrats. ([Civic Health and Institutions Project](https://www.chip50.org/reports/2024-us-elections-sources-of-news-and-information))

2. **Media struggles to reach divided audiences as Trump wins 2024 election amid growing distrust**. Despite extensive coverage of Trump‚Äôs campaign and policy proposals, his 2024 victory underscored the declining influence of traditional media, which faces challenges in reaching younger, fragmented audiences skeptical of perceived media bias. Media leaders acknowledge that Americans increasingly turn to nontraditional outlets and partisan influencers, revealing limitations in traditional news outlets' ability to sway public opinion. Legacy media faces an economic and cultural crossroads, needing to adapt to maintain relevance as news consumption shifts further from traditional cable, newspaper, and broadcast sources. ([Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/11/10/2024/a-tale-of-two-jets-the-old-media-grapples-with-its-new-limits))

3. **Trump‚Äôs 2024 win reflects voter discontent more than a clear endorsement of his policies**. Trump‚Äôs recent victory in the 2024 election largely stems from voter frustration with the status quo, particularly on issues like the economy, rather than strong support for Trump himself. The election highlights a pattern of "negative polarization," where many voters cast ballots in reaction against Biden rather than in support of Trump. The situation reflects broader disillusionment with both major parties, echoing historical examples where electoral choices resulted more from discontent with one party than enthusiasm for the other. ([The Dispatch](https://thedispatch.com/article/what-trumps-win-doesnt-mean/))

4. **Voters in three pro-Trump states support abortion rights, revealing complex views on personal liberties and candidate selection**. Despite voting for Trump, Arizona, Missouri, and Montana also passed measures enshrining abortion rights in state constitutions, suggesting that many voters support reproductive rights but prioritize other issues like the economy or immigration in presidential races. Experts note that for some Trump supporters, voting on abortion directly allowed them to separate reproductive rights from broader conservative stances, highlighting nuanced perspectives that may reflect Trump‚Äôs shift to a ‚Äústates‚Äô rights‚Äù approach. Analysts point to a continuing national trend of bipartisan support for abortion access, even as conservative candidates gain electoral success. ([Time](https://time.com/7174962/abortion-rights-won-states-voted-trump/))

5. **Trump‚Äôs narrow election win draws praise from Taliban and Russia**, raising concerns about foreign influence and domestic conflicts in U.S. governance. Foreign actors, including Afghanistan's Taliban and Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin, hailed Trump‚Äôs 2024 victory, each seeing it as an opportunity to reshape global dynamics against U.S.-led democratic ideals. Domestically, Trump‚Äôs apparent pivot away from traditional diplomatic channels, his close ties with Elon Musk, and growing influence within the Republican Party underscore shifts in governance style and internal GOP tensions. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs intent to pursue a hardline agenda faces obstacles, as recent elections reveal significant public support for policies like abortion rights and pathways to legal status for undocumented immigrants. ([Heather Cox Richardson](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/november-11-2024))

6. **Biden calls for unity, but MAGA movement's resistance to "cooling the temperature" persists**. In the wake of a Republican victory, Biden's appeal for Americans to "bring down the temperature" contrasts sharply with the MAGA movement's rhetoric and attitudes, which instead emphasize division and conflict. Conversations with Trump supporters and reflections on the recent Republican National Convention show a "unity" narrative among Republicans that mainly centers on enforcing conformity, while underlying tensions and hostility persist. Despite calls from Biden and figures like the Obamas for Americans to engage in good faith, the MAGA movement's alignment with divisive strategies keeps political temperatures high, fueling ongoing polarization. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2024/11/12/biden-wants-americans-to-bring-down-the-temperature--but-maga-will-not-let-that-happen/))

7. **Trump‚Äôs second-term agenda promises stability but poses risks of radical disruption**. Trump won reelection by appealing to voters seeking a return to pre-pandemic stability, but his second-term agenda includes sweeping and potentially destabilizing actions, like mass deportations, bureaucratic purges, and significant trade restrictions. Many of his supporters do not believe he will fully implement these extreme policies, pointing to past checks by government institutions that restrained his impulses. However, with a purged Republican caucus and a focus on loyalist staffing, Trump now faces fewer institutional constraints, raising the likelihood that he may pursue his promised‚Äîand more controversial‚Äîagenda.
