1/ **The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection will present its findings to the American public tonight**. The 90-minute hearing is the first in a series of six planned for this month and will lay out the evidence of what happened on the day of the attack, as well as the two months that preceded it as Trump led an effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The committee will present previously unreleased video of Trump’s top aides and family members testifying before its panel, footage revealing the role of the Proud Boys in the attack, and evidence showing Trump at the center of a “coordinated, multistep effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election,” which resulted in a mob of his supporters storming the Capitol and disrupting the peaceful transfer of power. The committee has interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, obtained more than 140,000 documents, and issued nearly 100 subpoenas. “We’ll demonstrate the multipronged effort to overturn a presidential election, how one strategy to subvert the election led to another, culminating in a violent attack on our democracy,” Adam Schiff said. “It’s an important story, and one that must be told to ensure it never happens again.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/09/us/politics/trump-jan-6-hearings.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/09/capitol-attack-house-hearing/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/09/1103285129/key-questions-the-jan-6-committee-will-tackle-in-its-hearings) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/09/jan-6-committee-pre-planning-capitol-violence-00038500) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/preview-jan-6-panel-hypes-first-public-hearing-rcna32618) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jan-6-committee-hearing-on-capitol-riot-set-to-feature-video-interviews-and-live-testimony-11654765200) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video-obtained-jan-committee-shows-scenes-capitol-violence/story?id=85270535))
