1/ **With eight days until a government shutdown, House Republicans canceled votes on two spending bills and adjourned for Veterans Day**. Republicans have only approved seven of the 12 full-year spending measures individually, which were due Oct. 1. Speaker Mike Johnson, however, has been forced to cancel votes on three of the five remaining spending bills in the past two weeks after facing the same internal Republican divisions that led to the ousting of Kevin McCarthy as speaker. Biden, meanwhile, told reporters: “I wish the House would just get to work. The idea we’re playing games with a shutdown at this moment is just bizarre.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2023/11/09/congress/another-house-gop-funding-snag-00126195) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/-ungovernable-house-republicans-nix-votes-two-funding-bills-shutdown-d-rcna124441) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/09/johnson-mccarthy-house-republicans-spending-bills) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-09/house-speaker-mike-johnson-is-running-out-of-time-to-avoid-government-shutdown?sref=MIBMEEoj) / [Punchbowl](https://punchbowl.news/archive/11923-punchbowl-news-am-2/))

2/ **With eight days until a government shutdown, Marjorie Taylor Greene forced a vote on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas instead of negotiating a deal to fund the government**. The so-called privileged resolution requires the House to vote on the matter within two legislative days, and accuses Mayorkas of “willful admittance of border crossers” and says he has a duty to protect the U.S. from an “invasion.” The resolution comes after two of Greene’s constituents were killed in a car accident after a car suspected of carrying smuggled migrants fled from police and crashed. The Department of Homeland Security, meanwhile, responded to the resolution, saying “while the House Majority has wasted months trying to score points with baseless attacks, Secretary Mayorkas has been doing his job and working to keep Americans safe."

3/ **After Ohio voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution, Democrats are moving to get similar measures on the 2024 ballot in Arizona, Nevada, and Florida**. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, voters have endorsed abortion rights via ballot initiatives in seven states: California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Vermont, and now Ohio. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, meanwhile, “is encouraging Republicans to clearly state their opposition to a national abortion ban and their support for reasonable limits on late-term abortions." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/09/democrats-abortion-election-plan-2023) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/abortion-ohio-ballot-initiatives-2024-election/index.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-urge-congress-candidates-oppose-national-abortion-ban-rcna124253))

* **The Supreme Court dismantled Roe. States are restoring it one by one**. "Now, 17 months later, the court has an answer: Americans want to preserve or restore Roe-like protections. In contest after contest, including a major victory in Ohio this week, voters decisively chose abortion rights over limitations — even in deep-red pockets of the country." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/09/abortion-rights-elections-red-states-00126225))

4/ **Following days of U.S. and international pressure, Israel agreed to daily, four-hour pauses in its military operations in the Gaza Strip** to facilitate the evacuation of civilians and to allow for humanitarian aid to enter from Egypt. Israel will now designate a specific area or neighborhood and announce each four-hour window at least three hours in advance. The Oct. 7 Hamas attack killed more than 1,400 people in Israel. Palestinian authorities say the death toll from Israel’s response in Gaza now exceeds 10,000 people, which a senior Biden administration official [say](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4301551-gaza-deaths-likely-higher-than-cited-us-official/) is likely “higher than is being cited,” and more than 1.5 million people have been displaced.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The third Republican presidential debate recap**: Vivek Ramaswamy attacked the debate moderator, called Republicans "a party of losers," referred to Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis as "Dick Cheney in three-inch heels," called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky an anti-democratic "comedian in cargo pants," proposed building a wall on the U.S.-Canada border, and suggested Biden might be replaced by Michelle Obama; Haley called Ramaswamy "scum" for bringing up her daughter during an exchange about TikTok. DeSantis, Tim Scott, and Chris Christie were also there. Trump, meanwhile, held a rally 10 miles away.

2. **Joe Manchin will not seek re-election**. The decision by the Senate's most conservative Democrat all but assures Republicans will pick up his Senate seat in West Virginia, a deeply red state. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/centrist-democratic-sen-joe-manchin-says-will-not-seek-re-election-202-rcna124486) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/09/manchin-not-running-2024-election-democrats) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/us/politics/manchin-democrats-senate-reelection.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/09/manchin-senate-reelection/))

3. **Earth just had its hottest 12 months ever recorded**. from November 2022 through October and found they were about 1.32 degrees Celsius — or 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit — above preindustrial averages, according to analysis from the nonprofit organization Climate Central. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/earth-just-hottest-12-months-ever-recorded-analysis-finds-rcna123917))

4. **The U.S. population will peak by 2080 and start declining**. In 1918, the U.S. recorded its only population decline when the flu pandemic and deployment of more than one million troops for World War I produced a small drop in the estimated population. The Census Bureau projects that the U.S. will "most likely" peak at nearly 370 million people by 2080 without immigration increases. People 65 years or older are expected to outnumber children under 18 by 2029.
