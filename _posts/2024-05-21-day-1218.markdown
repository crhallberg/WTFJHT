1/ **Israel‚Äôs Communications Ministry confiscated camera and broadcasting equipment from the Associated Press**, claiming the news agency had violated a new broadcasting law for providing a live feed of Gaza to Al Jazeera. The Associated Press said the seizure was ‚Äúnot based on the content of the feed but rather an abusive use by the Israeli government of the country‚Äôs new foreign broadcaster law.‚Äù Following swift condemnation from the Biden administration and journalism organizations, Israeli officials said the equipment would be returned. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also denounced the decision to seize press equipment, calling it "an act of madness." Lapid added: ‚ÄúThis government acts as if it has decided to make sure at any cost that Israel will be shunned all over the world. They went crazy.‚Äù [Earlier this month](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/05/06/day-1203/#3-the-israel-defense-forces-dropped), Israel shut down Al Jazeera‚Äôs operations in the country, accusing the Qatari-based news network of harming Israel‚Äôs security and inciting violence against its soldiers.
