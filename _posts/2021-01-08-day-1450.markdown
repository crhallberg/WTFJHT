1/ **House Democrats plan to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump on Monday for "incitement of insurrection."** A draft copy of the impeachment resolution states that Trump "has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and \[...\] thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States." The move follows Speaker Nancy Pelosi's earlier call for Trump to "immediately" resign for his role in a "horrific assault on our democracy," adding "If the President does not leave office imminently and willingly, the Congress will proceed with our action." Pence, meanwhile, privately ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. The House could vote on the articles of impeachment early as early as the middle of next week. More than 196 members of the House and 37 Senators have called for Trump to be removed from office.
