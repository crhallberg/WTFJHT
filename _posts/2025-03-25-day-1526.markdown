1/ **Trump dismissed concerns over a potential national security breach after an editor at The Atlantic was added to a Signal group chat where top officials discussed U.S. airstrikes in Yemen**. Trump stood by national security adviser Mike Waltz – who reportedly created the chat – saying, “Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man.” Despite mounting criticism, Trump claimed the incident had “no impact at all” and refused to consider firings, saying: “It’s just something that can happen.” The National Security Council, meanwhile, confirmed the chat “appears to be authentic,” contradicting Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s denial that “nobody was texting war plans.” But The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg said the group exchanged “attack sequence, weapons packages, targets” – details he withheld for national security reasons.

2/ **Top U.S. intelligence officials denied leaking classified war plans in a Signal group chat that included a journalist, but senators accused them of downplaying a serious national security breach**. “If this information had gotten out, American lives could have been lost,” Sen. Mark Warner warned, calling the incident “reckless, sloppy, and stunning.” At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard insisted “no classified material” was shared despite journalist Jeffrey Goldberg reporting receiving “precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing” before a U.S. strike in Yemen. Under pressure from senators, both officials deflected responsibility to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, saying classification decisions fell under his authority. “You’re the head of the intelligence community,” Sen. Angus King told Gabbard. “You’re supposed to know about classifications.” Ratcliffe defended his actions, saying his communications “were lawful.” Democrats, meanwhile, demanded accountability with Sen. Ron Wyden saying, “There ought to be resignations.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/fbi-cia-senate-national-security-threats-fe773ac76f8f01eba1d3a26409816396) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/25/signal-chat-atlantic-goldberg-release-texts) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/25/us/trump-hegseth-war-plans-leak-signal/ratcliffe-gabbard-signal-leak?smid=url-share) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/25/intelligence-leak-worldwide-threats-hearing-senate/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trumps-top-intelligence-officials-claim-no-classified-information-was-rcna197954) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/politics/intel-officials-shift-responsibility-yemen-chat/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-25/top-us-intel-officials-defend-signal-chats-seen-by-reporter) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/25/nx-s1-5339484/signal-war-plans-congress) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-intelligence-committee-worldwide-threats-hearing/) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-mike-waltz-signal-chat-atlantic-goldberg-5594771f) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5212589-warner-hegseth-waltz-intel-group-chat/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/25/tom-cotton-intelligence-agencies-hearing-00247089))

* **Several Trump officials who criticized Hillary Clinton for using a private email server discussed sensitive military plans in a private Signal group chat**. Participants included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz — all previously accused Clinton of recklessness and criminality.  In 2016, Hegseth said “any security professional” acting like Clinton should be “criminally prosecuted,” while Rubio declared, “Nobody is above the law.” The White House confirmed the chat’s authenticity, but hasn’t explained why officials bypassed secure systems they once demanded Clinton be punished for avoiding.

3/ **Russia and Ukraine separately agreed with the U.S. to limit military activity in the Black Sea and stop strikes on energy infrastructure**. Both pledged to “ensure safe navigation” and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes. Russia said it would implement the Black Sea truce only after U.S. sanctions on its agricultural banks are lifted – terms not mentioned in the U.S. announcement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Ukraine would comply but cautioned, “We do not trust them. In truth, the world does not trust Russia.” The U.S. also pledged to support prisoner exchanges and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.

4/ **Greenland’s government denied Trump’s claim that officials invited a U.S. delegation to the island, calling the visit “unwanted” and part of a "unacceptable pressure" by the U.S. to assert control over the territory**. The delegation – led by second lady Usha Vance and including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright – is scheduled to arrive Thursday despite objections from Greenland and Denmark. Trump, who recently told Congress the U.S. would take Greenland “one way or the other,” claimed the trip was friendly and said, “We were invited over there.” Greenland’s caretaker government publicly refuted that, saying: “We have not extended any invitations \[...\] and we have kindly requested all countries to respect this process.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/greenland-trump-00246587) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5212830-ahead-of-usha-vance-visit-danish-pm-calls-us-pressure-on-greenland-unacceptable/) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/03/25/trump-usha-vance-greenland/82647721007/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/25/nx-s1-5338849/usha-vances-planned-trip-to-greenland-causes-a-stir) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/greenland-future-trump-arctic-independence-denmark-minerals-4711a83c4490de99638db32029b668c9) / [United Press International](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2025/03/25/Denmark-Greenland-denounce-Usha-Vance-visit/6201742904783/))

5/ **Trump’s nominee to lead the Social Security Administration told senators he doesn’t support privatizing the agency**. Frank Bisignano promised to conduct a “total review” of disruptions linked to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. While Bisignano distanced himself from DOGE’s leadership, a whistleblower alleged he was briefed on agency operations, approved DOGE hires, and imposed staffing decisions before confirmation. While the White House continues to claim these measures are aimed at rooting out “fraud, waste, and abuse,” internal data shows improper payments accounted for less than 1% of total benefits from 2015 to 2022.

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Texas reported 18 new measles cases in the last five days, raising the total to 327**. Most cases are in unvaccinated children under 17. At least 40 people have been hospitalized, and one unvaccinated child has died – the first U.S. measles death in a decade. A second possible death is under review in New Mexico. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-327-cases-18-confirmed/story?id=120126483))

2. **Global energy demand rose 2.2% in 2024 – nearly twice the average of the past decade – as extreme heat drove up electricity use**, particularly for cooling in Asia. The IEA said weather effects alone explained the full rise in coal demand, and nearly half of record-high CO2 emissions. Despite rapid growth in renewables and nuclear, fossil fuel use also increased, with natural gas demand up 2.7%. The IEA noted that “about half of the increase in global emissions would have been avoided” if 2024 temperatures had matched 2023. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/25/extreme-heat-record-global-power-demand-2024) / [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-energy-demand-surged-in-2024-to-almost-twice-its-recent-average) / [Climate Action](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-energy-demand-surged-in-2024-to-almost-twice-its-recent-average))

3. **U.S. consumer confidence fell to a 12-year low in March**, with the Conference Board’s expectations index dropping 9.6 points to 65.2. The recession warning threshold is 80. Confidence in future job availability declined, as 16.7% of respondents expected more jobs, while 28.5% expected fewer. Federal job applications from employees at DOGE-targeted agencies, meanwhile, jumped 75% above 2022 levels. The spike followed layoffs by the Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, and showed high activity from workers at agencies like USAID, USDA, and CFPB.

4. **A White House adviser claimed the U.S. could sell gold reserves to fund large-scale Bitcoin purchases**. Bo Hines, director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, claimed this would be “budget-neutral” and supports a bill from Sen. Cynthia Lummis proposing the acquisition of 1 million Bitcoin using gold certificates. Hines said Trump would choose from “countless ideas” to grow U.S. digital assets, but gave no timeline or specifics. Trump called Bitcoin a tool for “economic growth” and pledged to make the U.S. a “bitcoin superpower,” though no formal policy has been announced.

5. **The Trump family's crypto firm announced the launch of a stablecoin** backed by U.S. Treasurys, dollar deposits, and cash equivalents. World Liberty Financial stablecoin, called USD1, coincides with the Trump administration’s push for legislation that would regulate and legitimize stablecoin issuers. The token will run on Ethereum and Binance blockchains, the latter tied to a firm whose founder has lobbied the Trump administration for legal relief. World Liberty claimed USD1 would offer “credible safeguards.” Earlier this year, Trump and Melania each launched meme coins – cryptocurrencies with no intrinsic value.
