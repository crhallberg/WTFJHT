1/ **The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter last year**, beating expectations despite high interest rates and fears of a recession. For the year overall, GDP grew 2.1% after growing 5.7% in 2021. Most economists, however, think the slowing economy will slide into at least a mild recession by midyear, triggered in part by the highest borrowing costs in decades.

2/ **Adam Schiff announced that he is running for U.S. Senate in 2024**, seeking to replace Dianne Feinstein. Schiff has served in the House since 2001. “We’re in the fight of our lives for the future of our country,” Schiff said. “Our democracy is under assault from MAGA extremists, who care only about gaining power and keeping it. And our economy is simply not working for millions of Americans, who are working harder than ever just to get by.” The 89-year-old Feinstein, meanwhile, won't announce her 2024 intentions until next year, saying “I need a little bit of time, so it's not this year.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/26/schiff-senate-feinstein-california/) / [Los Angeles times](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-01-26/adam-schiff-senate-campaign) / [KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/11939215/los-angeles-democrat-adam-schiff-a-key-trump-critic-running-for-feinsteins-senate-seat) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/adam-schiff-senate-california-rcna67636) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/26/adam-schiff-california-senate-bid-00079622) / [Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/is-dianne-feinstein-running/) [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/us/politics/adam-schiff-senate-california.html))

3/ **The Biden administration banned mining for 20 years in the watershed upstream from Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness**. The plan closes over 350 square miles to mineral and geothermal leasing critical to a proposed copper and nickel mine the Trump administration had tried to greenlight. A 20-year moratorium is the longest amount of time the Interior  Department can sequester the land without congressional approval.

4/ **The FBI seized the computer infrastructure used by a ransomware gang**, which extorted more than $100 million from more than 1,500 victims worldwide, including hospitals, schools, and others. The Justice Department said it used a court order to seize two back-end servers belonging to the Hive ransomware group in Los Angeles, and took control of the group’s website. The FBI said it gained access to Hive’s computer networks in July and acquired decryption keys the bureau could pass to victims to decrypt their systems, which prevented more than $130 million in ransom payments.

5/ **Florida students threatened to sue Gov. Ron DeSantis over his administration's decision to reject an Advanced Placement African American studies course**. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing three Florida AP honors high school students, accused DeSantis of violating federal and state constitutions by refusing to permit the course, adding that DeSantis “cannot exterminate our culture.” Florida Education Department, meanwhile, contends that the class is "contrary to Florida law and significantly lacks educational value."
