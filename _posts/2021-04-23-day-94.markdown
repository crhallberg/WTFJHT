1/ **The U.S. death rate in 2020 was the highest above normal ever recorded**. In 2020, 3.4 million people died in the U.S., representing a 16% increase from the previous year in what epidemiologists call “excess deaths,” or deaths above normal. The 1918 flu pandemic caused a 12% jump in excess deaths. The CDC has said about 10% of the deaths last year can be directly attributed to Covid-19.

* **The State Department issued more than 115 "Do Not Travel" advisories, citing "ongoing risks due to the COVID-19 pandemic."** As of last week, 33 countries were on the U.S. Do Not Travel list.

2/ **Sen. Ron Johnson questioned the “big push” to get everyone vaccinated against the coronavirus**, saying he sees “no reason to be pushing vaccines on people," asking "quite honestly, what do you care if your neighbor has one or not?” The Wisconsin Republican added that he was "highly suspicious" of the vaccine distribution effort, saying that it should be "limited" to the most vulnerable because – he claims – it’s "not a fully approved vaccine." At the same time, Johnson acknowledged that the coronavirus "vaccines are 95% effective."

3/ **A federal vaccine advisory panel recommended that the U.S. resume the use of the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine**, saying the benefits outweighed the risk of a rare blood clot disorder. The vaccine would carry a warning label about a potential increase in the risk of rare but severe blood clots and low platelet counts. CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky is expected to decide whether to formally accept the recommendation shortly. Out of nearly 8 million people who have received the J&J shot, health officials discovered 15 cases of a rare kind of blood clot, three of them fatal.

4/ **The Department of Housing and Urban Development withdrew a Trump-era proposal that would've allowed single-sex homeless shelters to discriminate against transgender people**. The Trump administration [rule](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/06/16/day-1244/#the-department-of-housing-and-urban) allowed federally funded homeless shelters to base admissions on a person's “biological sex” instead of their gender identity. “We are taking a critical step in affirming HUD’s commitment that no person be denied access to housing or other critical services because of their gender identity,” Housing Secretary Marcia Fudge said. “HUD is open for business for all.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/us/transgender-homeless-biden-trump.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/22/transgender-homeless-shelters-biden-trump/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/biden-admin-scraps-trump-era-proposal-limit-trans-protections-shelters-n1265010))
