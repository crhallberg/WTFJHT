1/ **The Biden administration will send cluster bombs to Ukraine, as well as armored vehicles and air defense missiles, in the next $800 million weapons package**. Cluster weapons have been banned in more than 100 countries because they scatter “bomblets” across large areas that can fail to explode on impact but can cause indiscriminate harm to civilians long after the fighting ends. Biden defended the decision saying “the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition” in the fight against Russia. National security adviser Jake Sullivan added that Russia has already targeted Ukraine with cluster bombs. Biden, meanwhile, said it's “premature” for Ukraine to join NATO, saying that Russia’s war in Ukraine needs to end before the alliance can consider adding Kyiv.

2/ **A U.S. drone strike killed a top Islamic State group leader in Syria**. Usamah al-Muhajir was killed while riding a motorcycle in northwestern Syria in an area where Russia conducts flight operations in support of the Syrian regime. Hours earlier, the same MQ-9 Reaper drones were "harassed" by Russian military jets for about two hours, according to the Defense Department.

3/ **A retired college football coach turned U.S. senator has single-handedly blocked hundreds of promotions for key military officers since February**. As a result, the Marine Corps are without a confirmed leader for the first time in 164 years and the nominations of more than 200 general and flag officers are currently stalled in the Senate. Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville is protesting the Defense Department's reproductive health policies, which offer time off and travel reimbursement to service members if they cannot obtain abortions in their state. Further, more than half of the current Joint Chiefs are expected to retire in the coming months without a Senate-approved successor in place. \[*Editor's note: Roll Tide*.\] ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/10/politics/marine-corps-tuberville-nominations-hold/index.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/us/politics/tuberville-abortion-joint-chiefs.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4088649-tuberville-hold-leaves-marines-leaderless/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/10/top-marine-david-berger-retires-00105449))

4/ **The House Freedom Caucus removed Marjorie Taylor Greene from their pro-Trump group "for some of the things she's done."** The caucus voted just before Congress went on recess at the end of June and days after Greene got into a verbal fight with Lauren Boebert, another Freedom Caucus member. Greene called Boebert a “little bitch” on the House floor. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/06/marjorie-taylor-greene-booted-out-of-freedom-caucus-member-says-00104997) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/06/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-house-freedom-caucus/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-removed-hard-line-house-freedom/story?id=100803339) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/07/06/marjorie-taylor-greene-republican-house-freedom-caucus/70388961007/))

5/ **A D.C. Court of Appeals discipline committee recommended that Rudy Giuliani be disbarred for “frivolous” and “destructive” efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election**. “He claimed massive election fraud but had no evidence of it,” the three-member panel wrote in its 38-page decision. The committee accused Giuliani of “dishonesty,” saying his "hyperbolic claims of election fraud" were "utterly false" and "reckless." The report concluded that Giuliani had "forfeited his right to practice law" in the District of Columbia.
