1/ **Trump asked the Supreme Court to keep his name on Colorado ballot**. [Last month](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2023/12/19/day-1064/#1-the-colorado-supreme-court-removed), the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump engaged in an insurrection before and during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and as a result Trump was "disqualified from holding the office of President under Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution." It was the first time that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment‚Äôs ‚Äúinsurrection clause‚Äù has been used to disqualify a presidential candidate. And, [last week](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/01/02/day-1078/#1-maine%E2%80%99s-secretary-of-state-removed) Maine‚Äôs secretary of state removed Trump from the state‚Äôs presidential primary ballot based on the Constitution‚Äôs ‚Äúinsurrectionist ban.‚Äù Both states ‚Äì which hold their primaries on Super Tuesday on March 5 ‚Äì temporarily put their decisions on hold so they could be appealed.

2/ **Biden will mark the third anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection with a speech at a key site in the Revolutionary War**. Biden will deliver remarks ‚Äì expected to highlight the stakes of the presidential election ‚Äì near a site where a group of militias gathered to form a coalition to fight for democracy in the 1770s, and where George Washington rallied troops into a unified army. ‚ÄúWe are running a campaign like the fate of our democracy depends on it, because it does,‚Äù Biden's reelection campaign said, adding: If Trump wins in November, he "will use all of his power to systematically dismantle and destroy our democracy." Trump faces 91 criminal charges stemming from his efforts to overturn his loss to Biden and three other felony cases.

* **üí° American democracy has overcome big stress tests since the 2020 election. More challenges are ahead**. "Trump is running for the White House again and has been dominating the Republican primary as the first votes approach. He has called for pardoning those prosecuted for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, continues to insist falsely that the 2020 election was 'stolen' and says he will use the federal government to seek revenge on his political enemies. Trump has used increasingly authoritarian rhetoric as he campaigns for the GOP nomination. If he wins, allies have been planning to seed the government with loyalists so the bureaucracy doesn‚Äôt hinder Trump‚Äôs more controversial plans the way it did during his first term."

3/ **At least six states were forced to evacuate their state capitols after receiving bomb threats**. No explosives were found and federal officials dismissed the threats as a hoax, which was sent via a mass email titled "Explosives inside of your State Capitol." The email was sent to government offices in at least 23 states, although no specific state was mentioned in the email. The FBI said it was aware of the ‚Äúnumerous hoax‚Äù bomb threats. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/03/state-capitols-bomb-threats) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-aware-hoax-bomb-threats-state-capitols-country/story?id=106080787) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/03/bomb-threats-state-capitols/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/03/us/state-capitols-threats/index.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/01/03/1222703888/several-state-capitols-evacuated-after-bomb-threats) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/state-capitol-threat-evacuation-lockdown-dfef5fbb98ec6572474807c260533b05))

4/ **A federal appeals court ruled that Texas hospitals and doctors are not required to perform emergency abortions** despite the Biden administration arguing that federal guidance takes priority over state laws. Texas had sued the Department of Health and Human Services over its 2022 guidance that required health providers to perform abortions in emergency situations, in accordance with a 1986 federal law that requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing care regardless of a patient‚Äôs ability to pay. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, however, concluded that the federal law ‚Äúdoes not mandate any specific type of medical treatment, let alone abortion.‚Äù The law ‚Äúdoes not govern the practice of medicine,‚Äù the court added.
