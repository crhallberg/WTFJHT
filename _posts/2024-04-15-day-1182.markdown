1/ **Jury selection in Trump’s criminal hush money trial began, marking the first criminal prosecution of an American president**. Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to conceal hush money payments during his 2016 campaign. If convicted, Trump could face up to four years in prison. The task of selecting 12 jurors and six alternates could take up to two weeks. More than half of the first 96 prospective jurors were dismissed after saying they can't be fair or impartial, and the court adjourned for the day with no jurors chosen. Trump, meanwhile, appeared to nod off several times, sitting motionless in his seat at the defense table, his back slightly arched, his head drooping onto his chest, and his mouth going slack. Trump will be required to attend the trial each day, which will take place four days a week and could last eight weeks. This is the first of Trump’s four criminal prosecutions to go to trial.

2/ **Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against launching new strikes on Iran**. Over the weekend, Iran launched a barrage of over 300 drones and missiles on Israel in retaliation for Israel’s assassination of two Iranian generals at the country’s embassy in Syria. Israeli air defense, supplemented by U.S. planes and warships, intercepted 99% of the incoming Iranian munitions. "You got a win. Take the win," Biden told Netanyahu, warning him that the U.S. would not support or participate in any offensive counter-strike against Iran. In private, Biden has reportedly said he fears that Netanyahu is trying to drag the U.S. into a wider regional conflict. Nevertheless, Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant claimed that Israel had no choice but to respond to the attack, vowing to "exact a price." Israel’s war Cabinet met for several hours and one official said Israel’s response to the Iranian attack may be "imminent," but "will be coordinated with the Americans." Iran, meanwhile, claimed its attack on Israel was “legitimate” and “responsible,” and that Tehran is not seeking to raise tension but will take “proportionate action” to defend itself.

3/ **The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Black Lives Matters organizer DeRay Mckesson**, leaving in place a lower court decision that effectively eliminated the right to organize a protest in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. At issue is whether an organizer of a protest can be held liable for injuries caused by another protester. Mckesson was sued by a Baton Rouge police officer, who was hit in the head with an object during a protest in July 2016 by an unknown assailant. Mckesson did not throw the object, and the fact is uncontested. Nevertheless, the officer sued Mckesson anyway because he was “in charge of the protest” and was “seen and heard giving orders” to protesters throughout the event. While there were no dissents, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote separately that the court's refusal to hear the case "expresses no view about the merits of Mckesson's claim." Sotomayor, however, noted a First Amendment decision from the Supreme Court last year and said she expects the 5th Circuit to "give full and fair consideration to arguments" regarding that ruling's impact in future proceedings in Mckesson's case.

4/ **Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas missed the court's scheduled cases with no explanation**. The court typically provides an explanation for why a justice is absent. Chief Justice John Roberts, instead, said in court that Thomas “is not on the bench today” but would "participate fully" in the two cases being argued based on the briefs and transcripts. Thomas, 75, is the eldest of the nine justices, as well as the court’s longest-serving member.
