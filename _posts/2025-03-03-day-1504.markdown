1/ **Trump confirmed that 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada would take effect Tuesday**, ending a one-month delay. ‚ÄúThe tariffs, you know, they‚Äôre all set,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúThey go into effect tomorrow.‚Äù He added there was ‚ÄúNo room left for Mexico or for Canada‚Äù for further negotiations and linked the tariffs to efforts to curb fentanyl trafficking. Trump also announced an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, doubling a levy he imposed last month. ‚ÄúTariffs are easy, they‚Äôre fast, they‚Äôre efficient and they bring fairness,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be very costly for people to take advantage of this country. They can‚Äôt come in and steal our money and steal our jobs and take our factories and take our businesses and expect not to be punished ‚Äî and they‚Äôre being punished by tariffs.‚Äù The Dow fell 1.48%, the S&P 500 dropped 1.76%, and the Nasdaq declined 2.64% as investors braced for economic fallout.

2/ **Congress has less than two weeks to pass a funding bill and prevent a government shutdown, but negotiations have stalled over Trump‚Äôs attempt to expand executive control over spending**. Trump and Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE have unilaterally cut federal contracts and jobs, arguing that limits on the president‚Äôs power to withhold funds are unconstitutional. Democrats demand guarantees that the administration will spend allocated funds, citing the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, while Republicans largely support Trump‚Äôs position. Republicans, meanwhile, are considering a stopgap bill to extend current funding through September. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/03/government-shutdown-trump-spending-powers/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/trump-bends-congress-to-his-will-on-spending-tax-cut-agenda) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/03/congress/johnson-budget-promises-spending-shutdown-00206931))

3/ **Congressional Republicans are urging Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to repair relations after an Oval Office meeting devolved into a heated argument and cast doubt on the future of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship**. The meeting, originally intended to finalize a U.S.-Ukraine rare-earth minerals deal and discuss a possible peace agreement with Russia, quickly fell apart as Trump and JD Vance accused Zelenskyy of failing to show enough gratitude for U.S. support, with Trump telling him, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the cards. You‚Äôre gambling with World War III.‚Äù Vance dismissed Zelenskyy‚Äôs call for security guarantees as a precondition for peace, calling his arguments a ‚Äúpropaganda tour.‚Äù Trump then canceled a planned press conference and the signing of the minerals deal, later declaring: ‚ÄúZelenskyy doesn‚Äôt want there to be Peace as long as he has America‚Äôs backing.‚Äù Some Trump allies escalated their attacks on Zelenskyy, with Senator Lindsey Graham saying, ‚ÄúHe either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.‚Äù House Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, defended Trump‚Äôs position but called for Zelenskyy to return to negotiations, warning, ‚ÄúHe needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead Ukraine.‚Äù And then other Republicans, like Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, tried to de-escalate tensions, insisting, ‚ÄúWe are 100% getting this train back on the tracks.‚Äù Despite the fallout, Trump signaled that the minerals deal might still be possible, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great deal for us.‚Äù Zelenskyy also expressed openness to signing the agreement, stating, ‚ÄúWe are ready.‚Äù Meanwhile, European leaders reaffirmed their support for Ukraine, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasizing that any peace deal must guarantee Ukraine‚Äôs sovereignty. Russia, however, welcomed the breakdown in U.S.-Ukraine ties, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov asserting, ‚ÄúSomeone should make Zelenskyy want peace.‚Äù ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/03/congress/congress-ukraine-zelenskyy-trump-deal-00209034) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/03/trump-presidency-news/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-us-support-after-week-tough-diplomacy-urges/story?id=119376839) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/zelensky-trump-europe-summit-starmer/index.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/trump-challenges-zelenskiy-for-saying-war-s-end-is-far-away) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/28/trump-zelensky-ukraine-meeting-minerals-deal) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/zelensky-to-meet-trump-in-bid-to-salvage-u-s-support-2e656025) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/trump-zelensky-us-ukraine-russia.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/trump-touts-resources-deal-with-zelenskiy-as-pathway-to-peace) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/zelenskyy-us-ukraine-relationship-salvaged-rcna194438) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/28/trump-ukraine-russia-zelensky/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-02/zelenskiy-says-he-s-ready-to-meet-trump-again-if-invited-to-us) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/02/zelensky-europe-leaders-meeting-ukraine/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/02/gop-trump-zelensky-meeting-lawmakers-react) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-zelenskyy-resign-fiery-oval-office-meeting-rcna194385))

4/ **The U.S. suspended offensive cyber operations against Russia as Trump seeks to end Putin‚Äôs war in Ukraine on terms that are widely seen as favorable to Moscow**. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt cyberattacks and information warfare efforts, a move critics say weakens U.S. security and benefits Moscow. The White House has also shifted diplomatic efforts to reengage with Russia following Trump‚Äôs meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the decision a ‚Äúcritical strategic mistake‚Äù that hands Russia a free pass. ([The Record](https://therecord.media/hegseth-orders-cyber-command-stand-down-russia-planning) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/01/trump-putin-russia-cyber-offense-cisa/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/hegseth-cyber-russia-trump-putin.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/03/hegseth-trump-russia-cyber-operations-ukraine) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/defense-secretary-pete-hegseth-orders-halt-offensive-cyber-operations-rcna194435) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/politics/us-cyber-operations-russia-suspend/index.html))

5/ **Russia and China are actively trying to recruit recently fired or at-risk federal employees**, particularly those with security clearances, to gain access to sensitive information. A Naval Criminal Investigative Service document assessed with "high confidence" that adversaries were using LinkedIn and other platforms to target disgruntled workers. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/us-intel-russia-china-attempt-recruit-disgruntled-federal-employees/))

6/ **The Pentagon is deploying 3,000 more active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border**, bringing the total to 9,000. The deployment includes 2,400 soldiers from a Stryker brigade combat team and 500 from an aviation brigade, reinforcing an earlier deployment of 1,500 troops in January. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized the administration‚Äôs commitment to ‚Äú100% operational control‚Äù of the border. The troops will assist U.S. Customs and Border Protection by providing security and logistical support, with Stryker armored vehicles being deployed to key border regions. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/01/southern-border-us-military-deployment-00002750) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/military-border-immigration.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/01/hegseth-border-troops-mexico-stryker/))

### ‚úèÔ∏è Notables.

 1. **Thomas Corry, the top spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, resigned abruptly after clashing with Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over the handling of a measles outbreak in Texas**. Corry reportedly disagreed with Kennedy‚Äôs approach and his reluctance to explicitly endorse vaccinations, despite the outbreak infecting at least 146 people and causing the first U.S. measles death in a decade. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, initially downplayed the outbreak as ‚Äúnot unusual‚Äù but later acknowledged the MMR vaccine‚Äôs role in preventing measles while emphasizing that vaccination is a ‚Äúpersonal decision.‚Äù ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/03/top-hhs-spokesperson-quits-00207000) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-vaccination-texas-kennedy.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/03/kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-vaccine))

 2. **Cryptocurrency prices spiked after Trump announced plans for a U.S. "Crypto Strategic Reserve"** that would include bitcoin, ether, solana, XRP, and cardano. Bitcoin briefly hit $95,000 before falling back to pre-announcement levels. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-crypto-bitcoin-digital-assets-reserve-2f4246434a657f248cd85296f14382f9) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-prices-jump-after-trump-announces-five-tokens-for-strategic-reserve-636f31d7) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/02/trump-crypto-reserve-announcement/))

 3. **TSMC will invest an additional $100 billion in U.S. chip manufacturing, bringing its total commitment to $165 billion**. The funds will support two more factories and a packaging facility in Arizona, where TSMC already operates three plants, and follows Trump‚Äôs tariff threats on imported chips and builds on the Biden-era CHIPS Act, which provided subsidies to semiconductor manufacturers. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tsmc-chip-manufacturing-tariffs-42980704ffca62e823182422ee4b7b83) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/technology/tsmc-investment-trump.html?smid=url-share) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/trump-chip-maker-tsmc-expected-to-announce-100-billion-investment-in-u-s-02a44399))

 4. **The U.S. Chips Program Office, which manages a $52 billion semiconductor subsidy, is losing about two-fifths of its staff due to Trump‚Äôs federal workforce cuts**. Around 60 employees, including those on probation, are departing, raising concerns about the implementation of the 2022 Chips and Science Act, which aims to boost domestic chip production. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-03/us-chips-act-office-is-losing-two-fifths-of-staff-to-trump-purge))

 5. **James Dennehy, head of the FBI‚Äôs New York office, was forced out after resisting the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts to identify agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases**. Dennehy, who was given the choice to resign or be fired, warned colleagues in an internal email that FBI personnel were being targeted ‚Äúbecause they did their jobs.‚Äù Trump has pledged to fire agents involved in investigating his supporters, calling them ‚Äúcorrupt.‚Äù ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/top-fbi-official-forced-criticizing-trump-pursuit-agents-investigated-rcna194610))

 6. **The Trump administration fired dozens of tech specialists from the General Services Administration‚Äôs 18F unit**, which built federal digital services. The move follows pressure from Elon Musk, who helped lead government downsizing. Employees say they were given no transition plan despite recent praise for their work on IRS and weather services. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/18f-technology-specialists-fired.html))

 7. **Trump fired 800 NOAA employees**. The cuts scientists and specialists responsible for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and ocean management. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/noaa-federal-workers-firings/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/national-weather-service-layoffs-trump-doge-a65360a1eb2500b7d47c9c966e383f4a) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/27/noaa-nws-mass-firings-trump-administration/))

 8. **A judge blocked Trump from firing Hampton Dellinger, head of the Office of Special Counsel, ruling that his removal would undermine the agency‚Äôs independence**. The administration plans to appeal, setting up a likely Supreme Court battle over presidential power. Dellinger vowed to keep protecting whistleblowers. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/01/hampton-dellinger-trump-office-special-counsel/))

 9. **The Trump administration is investigating Voice of America journalists for comments perceived as critical of Trump**. Correspondent Steven Herman was placed on leave, and the White House bureau chief reassigned. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/business/media/voice-of-america-trump.html))

10. **Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency removed over $4 billion in claimed savings from its "wall of receipts" ‚Äì its second major correction in a week**. The website, which tracks canceled government contracts, has seen its reported savings shrink from $16 billion to less than $9 billion due to repeated errors. Mistakes included miscalculations, double-counted cancellations, and claims for contracts that had already ended under previous administrations. Despite removing major errors, some inaccuracies remain, such as a $106 million savings claim for Coast Guard contracts that expired nearly two decades ago. DOGE has blamed federal agencies for the incorrect figures. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-wall.html))

11. **Israel halted all aid shipments to Gaza after the ceasefire with Hamas expired**, citing Hamas‚Äô refusal to accept a U.S.-backed extension proposal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the decision was made ‚Äúin full coordination with President Trump‚Äù and warned of further consequences if Hamas didn‚Äôt release more hostages. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement and using aid as ‚Äúblackmail.‚Äù Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio bypassed Congress to approve a $4 billion arms transfer to Israel, including thousands of 2,000-pound bombs. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/02/israel-gaza-netanyahu-aid) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/rubio-arms-israel.html))

12. **Trump signed an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States**, a first in U.S. history. The order rescinds a Clinton-era mandate requiring federal agencies and organizations receiving federal funds to provide language assistance to non-English speakers, though agencies may still offer multilingual services voluntarily. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-executive-order-english-official-language-5c0b7665) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-english-national-language-d4b000e593ae7db2ac8264a6dbc5078f) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/28/trump-english-official-language-order.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/trump-english-official-language.html))
