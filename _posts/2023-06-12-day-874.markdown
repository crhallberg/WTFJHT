1/ **Trump vowed to continue running for president even if he's convicted as part of the 37-count federal felony indictment**, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never leave.‚Äù Trump, who is not legally prohibited from running for president from prison or as a convicted felon, cast the charges as part of his ‚Äúfinal battle‚Äù with a ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù and "weaponized Department of Injustice." Trump's remarks at the Georgia Republican Party‚Äôs annual convention came one day after special counsel Jack Smith unsealed the 37-count federal indictment, which he called "a political hit job" by a "deranged" Smith. "In the end, they're not coming after me. They're coming after you," Trump said. "I'm just standing in their way."

2/ **A Montana judge will hear arguments in a first-of-its-kind lawsuit by 16 young people challenging Montana's pro-fossil fuel policies**. In Held v.

4/ **U.S. spy agencies have bought a ‚Äúlarge amount‚Äù of ‚Äúsensitive and intimate information‚Äù on Americans**, according to new report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Although most of the commercially available data from cars, phones, web tracking technologies, the Internet of Things, and more has been stripped of personal information and anonymized, the government said it's trivial ‚Äúto deanonymize and identify individuals.‚Äù The report notes that the government can ‚Äúpersistently‚Äù track the phones of ‚Äúmillions of Americans‚Äù without a warrant so long as it purchases the information, adding ‚ÄúThe government would never have been permitted to compel billions of people to carry location tracking devices on their persons at all times, to log and track most of their social interactions, or to keep flawless records of all their reading habits.‚Äù ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-spy-agencies-buy-vast-quantities-of-americans-personal-data-report-says-f47ec3ad) / [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/odni-commercially-available-information-report/?redirectURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fodni-commercially-available-information-report%2F))
