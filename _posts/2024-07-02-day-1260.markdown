1/ **Biden denounced the Supreme Court's decision to grant convicted felon Trump broad immunity from prosecution, warning that it sets "a dangerous precedent" and "undermines the rule of law."** Biden said the court's 6-3 decision puts "virtually no limits on what a president can do," and all but ensures Trump won't be tried on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election before the upcoming 2024 election. The court sent the case back to the trial judge to determine which, if any of Trump’s actions, were part of his official duties and thus were protected from prosecution. “The American people must decide if Trump’s embrace of violence to preserve his power is acceptable,” Biden added. “Perhaps most importantly, the American people must decide if they want to entrust the presidency once again to Donald Trump — now, knowing he’ll be more emboldened to do whatever he pleases, whenever he wants to do it.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/biden-address-trump-supreme-court.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/01/biden-denounces-supreme-court-immunity/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/01/nx-s1-5025769/biden-scotus) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/biden-election-2024-debate-c47243b3cedb88ce6ea7905a1975e164) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/02/biden-trump-immunity-supreme-court-decision))

* **Supreme Court’s Trump Immunity Ruling Avoids the Obvious: He’s Running Again**. The decision all but ensures a trial — and a verdict — won’t happen before the Nov. 5 election, an outcome that Trump’s critics slammed as helping him ahead of the election.

Justice Sotomayor dissented, “With fear for our democracy." ([Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/supreme-court-trump-immunity-ruling))

* **Biden Campaign Brushes Off Idea of Reforming the Supreme Court.** The campaign waved off the notion that the court’s bombshell Trump immunity ruling would move Biden to embrace reform ([Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/biden-supreme-court-reform-trump-immunity-1235051044/))

2/ **Trump threatened to prosecute his perceived political enemies in a second term**, amplifying posts on social media calling for a televised military tribunal for Liz Cheney, as well as the jailing of Biden, Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, Mike Pence, and members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. “ELIZABETH LYNNE CHENEY IS GUILTY OF TREASON,” reads one post that Trump amplified on his social media platform. “RETRUTH IF YOU WANT TELEVISED MILITARY TRIBUNALS.” And, on the same day that Steve Bannon reported to prison for contempt of Congress, Trump – again – blamed Biden for what he claims is a "weaponization" of the justice system, suggesting that Biden is "going to pay a big price" for it. "What they've done in this country is unthinkable." The Biden campaign, meanwhile, warned that Trump “is doubling down on threats to our democracy,” adding that “the Supreme Court has now paved the way for him to do exactly what he is saying he will if he wins.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/trump-liz-cheney-treason-jail.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/trump-liz-cheney-military-tribunal/index.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-biden-pay-big-price-weaponization-justice-system/story?id=111596240))

3/ **The judge in Trump’s election interference trial involving falsified business records delayed sentencing until Sept. 18**, at the earliest, to weigh the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. Justice Juan Merchan set the new date after Trump sought to challenge his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, making him the first former president in U.S. history to be convicted of a crime. Merchan said he would rule on the immunity finding on Sept. 6, and that sentencing would take place only “if necessary.” The delay also means Trump will not be sentenced until after he is formally nominated for president at the Republican National Convention on July 15.

* **Supreme Court's immunity ruling will delay Trump's Jan. 6 case until after the election**. "The conservative majority's decision will likely set off hearings to determine what allegations in Trump’s federal interference case are official acts and thus potentially immune."

4/ **The New York state Supreme Court disbarred Rudy Giuliani over his failed effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election**, saying the seriousness of Giuliani’s misconduct couldn’t be overstated. “He baselessly attacked and undermined the integrity of this country’s electoral process,” the court said, noting that Giuliani "communicated demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers, and the public at large" regarding the 2020 election. “In so doing, respondent not only deliberately violated some of the most fundamental tenets of the legal profession, but he also actively contributed to the national strife that has followed the 2020 Presidential election, for which he is entirely unrepentant.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/nyregion/giuliani-disbarred-new-york-trump.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/02/giuliani-disbarred-new-york/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/rudy-giuliani-disbarred-in-new-york-00166232) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/02/rudy-giuliani-disbarred-new-york) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/giuliani-new-york-disbarred-81b327f9ab1f98548cb888f8e652c9a8) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/rudy-giuliani-disbarred-by-new-york-supreme-court-74dfaefe?mod=hp_lead_pos3) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/rudy-giuliani-loses-his-new-york-law-license-for-trump-2020-work?srnd=homepage-americas&sref=MIBMEEoj) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/rudy-giuliani-officially-disbarred-in-new-york/index.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/former-trump-lawyer-rudy-giuliani-disbarred-in-new-york.html))
