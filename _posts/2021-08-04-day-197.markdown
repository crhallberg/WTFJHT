1/ **The FDA plans to fully approve the Pfizer vaccine by the start of next month.** Giving final approval to the Pfizer vaccine — rather than relying on the emergency authorization granted late last year — could help increase inoculation rates at a moment when the highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus is sharply driving up the number of new cases.

2/ **New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women**, according to a report by state Attorney General Letitia James' office. The investigation found that Cuomo engaged in "unwelcome and nonconsensual touching," and made comments of a "suggestive" sexual nature to current and former state employees, as well as a number of women outside of state government. Joe Biden and the entire NY Democratic congressional delegation have called on Cuomo to resign.

3/ **The State Department is investigating the whereabouts of a $5,800 bottle of whiskey the Japanese government gave to Mike Pompeo in 2019.** It's unclear whether Pompeo ever received the gift, as he was traveling in Saudi Arabia on June 24, 2019, the day that Japanese officials gave it to the State Department.

4/ **Los Angeles is considering requiring vaccine proof at restaurants, gyms, and indoor sporting events**. The mandate would require eligible individuals to demonstrate that they’ve received at least one vaccination dose to visit indoor places such as restaurants, bars, retail stores, gyms, spas, movie theaters, stadiums and concert venues. If passed, the measure would be the widest-ranging vaccination verification effort in the city to date.

5/ **Trump is trying to block the Treasury Department from handing over his tax returns to Congress**. Lawyers for Trump said the stated reason for seeing the returns, to examine how the IRS audits presidents, is simply a pretext for wanting to look for something embarrassing.

6/ **Mexico plans to sue U.S.-based gunmakers over the flow of arms across the southern border**. Mexico claims that lax controls over weapons sales are fueling arms-trafficking and violence.
