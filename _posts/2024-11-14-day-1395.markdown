1/ **Trump asked Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to serve as secretary of health and human services**, putting one of the nation's leading vaccine skeptics in charge of America's health care agencies. Kennedy has spread discredits conspiracy theories that vaccines cause autism, opposed CDC guidance on water fluoridation for dental health, backed the consumption of raw milk against FDA warnings, and endorsed hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, despite FDA findings that it is ineffective. In October, Trump said he would let Kennedy ‚Äúgo wild on health,‚Äù ‚Äúgo wild on the food,‚Äù and ‚Äúgo wild on medicines‚Äù if reelected. HHS oversees both the CDC and the FDA. The position requires Senate confirmation.

* **üß© What's at stake?** The nomination of RFK Jr. to lead HHS could drastically alter the landscape of public health, possibly compromising the scientific standards that guide health decisions affecting millions. Health agencies rely on public trust, which is already challenged by misinformation and political divides. A leader who challenges these agencies on unfounded grounds may exacerbate skepticism, weaken preventative health efforts, and put the nation at greater risk during health emergencies. Furthermore, if policies diverge from evidence-based practices, future generations may inherit a weakened public health infrastructure. Protecting the integrity of public health agencies and reinforcing the trustworthiness of scientific research is essential for a resilient, well-prepared society.

2/ **Matt Gaetz abruptly resigned from Congress hours after Trump announced his nomination for attorney general**. The resignation comes two days before the House Ethics Committee was scheduled to release a "highly damaging" report detailing allegations against Gaetz, including sex trafficking involving underage girls, illicit drug use, and accepting bribes. Gaetz's resignation means he is no longer a congressman, and the committee no longer has jurisdiction over him. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/matt-gaetz-ethics-committee-report.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-attorney-general-matt-gaetz-justice-department-9d51501fb6ad5c04b5b4113d3a6a584b) / [Punchbowl News](https://punchbowl.news/article/house/matt-gaetz-investigation-ethics-capitol/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/14/matt-gaetz-resigns-congress-ethics-committee) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-resigns-congress-00189488) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-ethics-investigation-resign/))

3/ **Republican and Democratic senators called for access to the House Ethics Committee report into Matt Gaetz as part of the confirmation hearing process**. Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged the House Ethics Committee to ‚Äúpreserve and share‚Äù its report on  Gaetz. ‚ÄúThe sequence and timing of Mr. Gaetz‚Äôs resignation from the House raises serious questions about the contents of the House Ethics Committee report. We cannot allow this valuable information from a bipartisan investigation to be hidden from the American people,‚Äù Durbin read. Several Republican senators, meanwhile, have expressed skepticism about Gaetz‚Äôs ability to secure the necessary votes for confirmation. While some Republican members remain open to considering Gaetz's nomination, others view it as a "long shot," suggesting that Trump may be testing the limits of Senate loyalty. John Cornyn, a key Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, added: "I think there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation, including, whatever the House Ethics Committee is generated." However, Michael Guest, the chairman of the Ethics Committee, suggested that he was not inclined to release the investigative findings now that Gaetz has resigned, saying ‚ÄúOnce we lose jurisdiction, there would not be a report that would be issued.‚Äù ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senators-want-details-matt-gaetz-ethics-probe-vote-attorney-general-rcna180164) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5191708/gaetz-nomination-republicans-ethics-probe) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4990433-durbin-gaetz-house-ethics-report/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/growing-calls-house-ethics-committee-share-report-matt/story?id=115869535) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/lawmakers-demand-ethics-report-gaetz.html?smid=url-share) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-sends-shockwaves-through-washington-with-gaetz-pick-c1a7f468) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/14/trump-administration-transition/#link-UONRGJR6P5DSDM6CJI7YYODU2A) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/14/congress/guest-stands-firm-on-gaetz-report-00189592))

* **üö® REPORT: The woman at the center of a Justice Department probe testified to the House Ethics Committee that Matt Gaetz had sex with her when she was 17**, an allegation linked to Gaetz‚Äôs close associate Joel Greenberg, who admitted to sex trafficking charges. Greenberg's plea agreement and other evidence, including witness testimonies and Venmo records, have been central to the probe, which the committee may soon report on as deliberations continue.

4/ **A satirical fake news outlet bought an actual fake news site**. The Onion won the bidding for conspiracy theorist Alex Jones‚Äô Infowars in a bankruptcy auction. The Onion said it plans to ‚Äúend Infowars‚Äô relentless barrage of disinformation for the sake of selling supplements and replace it with The Onion‚Äôs relentless barrage of humor for good‚Äù when it relaunches in January 2025. The bid was sanctioned by the families of the victims of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, who won a $1.4 billion defamation lawsuit against Jones for calling the massacre a hoax. In September, a judge approved auctions to liquidate Jones‚Äô assets, including Infowars.

### üîç Dept. of Context and Consequence. 

*A deeper look at today‚Äôs headlines ‚Äì why it matters and what‚Äôs at stake.*

1. **Democrats face declining influence as population shifts weaken traditional strongholds**. The Democratic Party's anti-growth policies in states like California and New York are resulting in population loss and the shrinking of their influence in national elections, as congressional seats shift to faster-growing Republican-led states like Texas and Florida. High housing costs and limited affordable housing have pushed residents, particularly lower-income households, to more affordable regions, intensifying the challenges Democrats face in retaining electoral power. Without addressing the housing crisis and economic concerns driving people away, Democrats risk further erosion of support, potentially limiting their competitiveness in future presidential races and reshaping the party‚Äôs long-term prospects. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/democrat-states-population-stagnation/680641/))

2. **Climate tech companies brace for potential loss of federal support under Trump administration**. With Trump‚Äôs plan to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and cut unspent funds, climate tech companies are reassessing strategies to survive without federal incentives that bolstered their growth under Biden. Some depend heavily on clean energy tax credits, while others leverage international markets to reduce reliance on U.S. federal climate policies. The loss of certain tax credits may not impact early adopters but could affect price-sensitive customers as they expand. As Trump‚Äôs administration signals potential cuts to clean energy programs, companies anticipate increased reliance on state policies and private funding to drive future sustainability efforts. ([Heatmap](https://heatmap.news/technology/trump-climate-tech))

3. **Progress on global climate goals falters as emissions rise, critical 2030 targets slip further out of reach**. Efforts to meet the world‚Äôs 2030 climate targets are falling behind, with emissions continuing to increase and major sectors like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and deforestation showing shortfalls. Re-elected, Trump‚Äôs administration could further slow US progress as he pledges to roll back climate policies, adding global challenges. Key initiatives in renewable energy, biodiversity protection, and sustainable financing need significant acceleration to mitigate impacts of rising temperatures, which could reduce global GDP by up to 12% if unchecked. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-cop29-climate-change-targets/))

4. **Trump‚Äôs win driven by economic dissatisfaction, social disconnects, and fractured media influence**. In her post-election analysis, Kyla Scanlon argues Trump‚Äôs victory was fueled by economic grievances, lack of faith in political institutions, and a media landscape that amplifies misinformation. Despite positive economic data, persistent affordability issues, especially in housing, and a sense of abandonment by policymakers left many voters disillusioned, leading them to support Trump as a symbol of disruption. The divide between institutional trust, policy intentions, and personal financial reality deepened the "vibecession"‚Äîa growing disconnect between statistical progress and lived hardship‚Äîand is now pushing the U.S. toward a complex future in an era of information bubbles and distrust. ([Kyla Scanlon](https://kyla.substack.com/p/how-trump-won-what-happens-next-and))

5. **Trump‚Äôs second term could swing between hawkish promises and moderate moves**. Matthew Yglesias explores Trump‚Äôs unpredictable second term, noting that while his newly appointed hawkish advisors suggest an aggressive foreign policy stance, Trump‚Äôs track record shows he might pursue more symbolic ‚Äúown the libs‚Äù moves rather than substantial policy shifts. This approach, where he uses progressive outrage to rally conservative support, has allowed Trump to hold sway over the Republican base, sometimes in opposition to traditional conservative policies. Trump‚Äôs team appointments could signal a more confrontational tone, but as past administrations show, campaign promises don‚Äôt always align with presidential actions.
