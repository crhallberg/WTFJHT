1/ **A Georgia judge blocked a new state rule that would have required counties to hand-count ballots cast on Election Day**. ‚ÄúToo much, too late,‚Äù Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his decision, expressing concern that the "11th-and-one-half hour implementation of the hand count rule" would undermine public confidence in the election results and lead to "administrative chaos." The rule, passed by the Republican State Election Board, would have required poll workers in Georgia to open ballots and count them by hand to ensure that the total number of ballots matched the total counted by tabulating machines. It was set to go into effect Oct. 22 ‚Äì two weeks before Election Day. Early voting in the state is already underway. [Separately](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/elections/georgia-election-ruling.html), McBurney also ruled that Georgia county election officials can't delay or decline to certify election results based on suspicions of fraud, error, or abuse, writing that elections officials have a "mandatory fixed obligation to certify election results."

2/ **Trump‚Äôs top general called him a ‚Äúfascist to the core‚Äù and "the most dangerous person to this country,"** according to Bob Woodward's book, "[War](https://amzn.to/4eLbwtm)." Retired U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2019 to 2023, told Woodward that Trump "is the most dangerous person ever. I had suspicions when I talked to you about his mental decline and so forth, but now I realize he‚Äôs a total fascist. He is now the most dangerous person to this country." Milley repeated: "A fascist to the core.‚Äù Meanwhile, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a senior member of the Homeland, Armed Services and Judiciary committees, said he expects Trump‚Äôs suggestion that he could deploy National Guard or U.S. military on American soil to handle what he called ‚Äúthe enemy from within‚Äù on Election Day to generate new support for his legislation to restrict a president‚Äôs authority to deploy the military inside the U.S. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/11/mark-milley-trump-fascist-bob-woodward-book) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/bob-woodward-book-mark-milley-trump) / [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-fascist-general-woodward-book-b2627972.html) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4929487-trump-dangerous-milley-woodward/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/16/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/richard-blumenthal-trump-military-comments-00183936))

3/ **Trump, repeatedly dismissing concerns by economists that his policies would have a net-negative impact on the economy, called tariffs ‚Äúthe most beautiful word in the dictionary‚Äù and claimed ‚ÄúI was always very good at mathematics‚Äù while discussing his economic agenda**, in an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago. Trump has floated ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù tariffs of 10% to 20% on every import, 60% levies on imports from China, and higher rates in other circumstances. When questioned about the specifics of his plan and how tariffs on every imported product would lead to higher prices for consumers, Trump suggested that companies should just move production into the U.S. ‚ÄúAll you have to do is build your plant in the United States and you don‚Äôt have any tariffs.‚Äù When told "that will take many, many, many years,‚Äù Trump replied: "You‚Äôve been wrong all your life on this stuff.‚Äù The national debt, meanwhile, is approaching $36 trillion. Trump‚Äôs economic agenda is expected to cost as much as $15 trillion over a decade with gross domestic product 9.7% lower than current forecasts.
