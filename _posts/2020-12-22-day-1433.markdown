2/ **The Senate approved more than $900 billion in emergency economic relief**, government funding, and tax cuts shortly after the House passed the same package, which now head to Trump's desk. While Trump is expected to sign that measure, logistical complexities ‚Äì it must be enrolled on parchment paper, physically delivered to the White House and reviewed by administration lawyers ‚Äì prevented the bill from quickly getting to him. Separately, Trump signed a seven-day government spending bill, averting a federal shutdown. Tucked inside the spending bill was over $110 billion in tax breaks for special interests. The stimulus bill will [also](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/22/federal-reserve-economic-relief-republicans-449883) limit the Federal Reserve's ability to aid businesses, states, and cities through emergency lending. Biden, meanwhile, warned that the ‚Äúdarkest days‚Äù of the pandemic "are ahead of us, not behind us." He called on Congress to prepare for a third stimulus package early next year.

3/ **Trump met privately with a group of congressional Republicans at the White House in preparation of a final effort to overturn the election results**. The discussion reportedly focused on a contingent of House and Senate Republicans who are committed to objecting to the election results, prompting a marathon debate on the floor on Jan. 6, which would roll into Jan. 7. Rep. Mo Brooks  said there are plans to challenge the results in six states, which could lead to about 18 hours of debate. Brooks and the group also met with Pence, who will preside over the joint session of Congress when lawmakers certify the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6. Trump, meanwhile, has been complaining about Pence, who he views as not fighting hard enough for him. In particular, Trump reportedly views Pence's constitutional duty to certify the election result as the ultimate betrayal. Trump, [meanwhile](https://www.axios.com/trump-mcconnell-election-283ae665-ef68-43fa-ba2e-1bfdeabf1f81.html), lashed out at Mitch McConnell for acknowledging Biden's victory, sending Republican senators a slide taking credit for McConnell's career that read: "Sadly, Mitch forgot‚Äù ‚Äì a reference to his June 19 tweet endorsing the Senate leader.

4/ **Russian hackers accessed dozens of email accounts used by senior officials at the Treasury Department**. ‚ÄúThe agency suffered a serious breach, beginning in July, the full depth of which isn‚Äôt known,‚Äù Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said. ‚ÄúTreasury still does not know all of the actions taken by hackers, or precisely what information was stolen," but it "appears to be significant." Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, meanwhile, said ‚ÄúI can assure you, we are completely on top of this,‚Äù but did not explain how the Russian intrusion was not detected for more than four months.
