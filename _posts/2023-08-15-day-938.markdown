1/ **Trump and 18 others were indicted by an Atlanta grand jury in connection with efforts to overturn Biden‚Äôs 2020 win in Georgia**. The 41-count indictment ‚Äì 13 of which were lodged against Trump ‚Äì is the fourth time Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has been indicted since leaving office. In all, he faces 91 felony charges. Trump now has 10 days to turn himself in to face accusations that he orchestrated a ‚Äúcriminal enterprise‚Äù to remain in power despite losing the election by violating the state‚Äôs racketeering act, soliciting a public officer to violate their oath, conspiring to impersonate a public officer, conspiring to commit forgery, and conspiring to file false documents. ‚ÄúTrump and the other Defendants charged in this Indictment refused to accept that Trump lost, and they knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump,‚Äù the indictment states. Racketeering carries up to 20 years in prison, while conspiracy can result in a minimum sentence of one year in prison with a variable maximum sentence. Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, Jeffrey Clark, John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Kenneth Chesebro, and several others were all charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization act. The charges follow a 2 1/2-year criminal investigation by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. The probe was [launched](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/02/10/day-22/#2-georgia-prosecutors-opened-a-crimi) after [audio leaked](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/01/04/day-1446/#1-trump-pressured-georgia%E2%80%99s-secretar) of Trump‚Äôs Jan. 2, 2021, phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to ‚Äúfind‚Äù him 11,780 votes to overturn his 2020 loss in the state.

2/ **The Mar-a-Lago property manager charged in the Trump classified documents case pleaded not guilty in Florida federal court**. Carlos De Oliveira is accused of conspiring with Trump and Walt Nauta to delete security footage the Justice Department sought as part of its efforts to retrieve sensitive files from Trump after he left office. After the security footage was subpoenaed, De Oliveira allegedly told an IT employee at Mar-a-Lago that ‚Äúthe boss‚Äù wanted the footage deleted. De Oliveira was unable to enter a plea in late July and again last week because he was unable to find a Florida-based lawyer. Magistrate Judge Shaniek Maynard, meanwhile, wished De Oliveira "good luck."

Last year, the Education Department said payment-tracking procedures "revealed significant flaws" in the system and that many borrowers were "missing out on progress toward [income-driven repayment] forgiveness." The administration said it was addressing "historical failures" in which qualifying payments by people enrolled in income-driven repayment plans were not properly accounted for.
