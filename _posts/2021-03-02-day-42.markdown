1/ **Biden said the U.S. expects to have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to vaccinate every adult in the nation by the end of May ‚Äì two months earlier than anticipated**. The White House said it was increasing supply of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to states next week to 15.2 million doses per week ‚Äì¬†up from 14.5 million. States will also receive 2.8 million doses of Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs vaccine this week, with the supply climbing¬†to 4-6 million by the end of March and 5-6 million by the end of April. White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said states should prepare to administer 17-18 million total weekly doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by early April.

Biden has promised enough vaccine doses for 300 million Americans by the end of July.

2/ **The World Health Organization warned that the global number of new coronavirus cases rose for the first time in nearly two months**. Over the past week, cases jumped in every region except for Africa and the Western Pacific. The WHO blamed the surge on new variants and premature efforts to lift public health restrictions.

Meanwhile, more than 6,000 people were hospitalized with Covid-19 in Texas today, with more than 1,700 of those patients in intensive care units. Nevertheless, Greg Abbott said the ‚Äústate mandates are no longer needed.‚Äù Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves also lifted his state‚Äôs mask mandate, saying that hospitalizations in the state have ‚Äúplummeted‚Äù and that cases have declined dramatically. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, meanwhile, said she was ‚Äúreally worried‚Äù about rolling back restrictions in some states, cautioning that with ‚Äústalling‚Äù cases and new variants spreading, ‚Äúwe stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/world/greg-abbott-texas-masks-reopening.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/02/texas-to-lift-mask-mandate-472690) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gov-greg-abbott-lift-texas-mask-mandate-open-state-100-n1259329) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/02/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/))

4/ **FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Jan. 6 insurrection was ‚Äúan inspiration to a number of terrorist extremists‚Äù and that he considers the attack ‚Äúdomestic terrorism.‚Äù** Wray defended the FBI's handling of intelligence in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, saying the FBI tracked "a large amount of information" about the potential for violence, but he didn't explain what the FBI did with the information. Wray also told lawmakers that there‚Äôs no evidence indicating that the rioters were "fake Trump protesters" ‚Äì a baseless claim that Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has advanced in recent weeks in an effort to downplay the violence committed by the pro-Trump mob. Wray said that there are 2,000 domestic terrorism investigations ‚Äì up from almost 1,000 when he first started in 2017. ‚ÄúThe problem of domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now," Wray added, "and it‚Äôs not going away anytime soon.‚Äù ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/02/fbi-director-capitol-attack-hearing-472477) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/fbi-director-christopher-wray-will-face-questions-capitol-riot-domestic-n1259142) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/christopher-wray-fbi-capitol-riot/2021/03/01/a49d177a-7ae7-11eb-85cd-9b7fa90c8873_story.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/politics/fbi-director-chris-wray-january-6-riot-hearing/index.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/02/us/joe-biden-news/the-fbi-director-calls-the-riot-domestic-terrorism-and-defends-the-bureaus-handling-of-threats) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/972854119/wray-defends-fbis-intelligence-sharing-ahead-of-jan-6-capitol-attack) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/fbi-chief-to-set-out-extremist-threat-to-u-s-after-capitol-riot?srnd=politics-vp&sref=MIBMEEoj) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-director-testifies-time-capitol-assault/story?id=76187365&cid=clicksource_4380645_5_three_posts_card_hed) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-director-to-testify-on-capitol-hill-about-jan-6-riots-11614681004?mod=hp_lead_pos7))

5/ **The Supreme Court is hearing arguments over two Arizona voting restrictions** ‚Äì one requiring election officials to discard ballots cast at the wrong precinct and the other making it a crime to collect ballots for delivery to polling places.

The justices reportedly seemed poised to uphold both Arizona laws.
