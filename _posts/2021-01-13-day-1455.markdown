1/ **The House voted to impeach Trump, making him the only American president to be impeached twice**. Ten Republicans, including the House's No. 3 Republican, Liz Cheney, joined with all Democrats in a 232 to 197 vote to impeach Trump for "willful incitement of insurrection" ‚Äì¬†the gravest charge ever lodged against a sitting president ‚Äì for his role in a riot by his supporters that left five dead and the Capitol ransacked. "We know that the President of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country," Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor ahead of the vote. "He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love."
