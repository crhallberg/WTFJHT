1/ **Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic relief package into law** ‚Äì his first major legislative achievement in office. ‚ÄúThis historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country,‚Äù Biden said during signing. The American Rescue Package authorizes a third round of one-time stimulus payments up to $1,400 for most Americans, extends enhanced unemployment benefits, and changes the tax code to benefit families with children. The package also unlocks new federal aid to help schools reopen, aid cities and states with budget shortfalls, provide billions in aid for small businesses, and assists in the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. has officially allocated over $5 trillion in funding for Covid-19 relief.
