1/ **A manhunt for the gunman suspected of killing 18 people and injuring 13 others in Maine is ongoing**. Suspect, Robert Card, shot and killed the victims at a bowling alley and restaurant in Lewiston and then fled. He remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous, and residents are under a shelter-in-place advisory. Biden urged Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, similar to the ones used by Card, [saying](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/26/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-the-shooting-in-lewiston-maine/) this "is not normal, and we cannot accept it." This is the 36th mass killing in the United States this year and marks the deadliest shooting of 2023 thus far.

2/ **The Israeli military briefly sent tanks into the Gaza Strip as part of a "targeted raid" in order "to prepare the battlefield" in preparation for the "next stages of combat."** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was “preparing for a ground incursion” of Gaza, but that he “won’t specify” when or how it would occur. The U.N. has warned that, despite Israeli evacuation warnings, “nowhere is safe in Gaza.” Israel has also rejected international calls for a cease-fire to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid supplies to the Gaza Strip. Since the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, the Israeli military has struck more than 7,000 targets inside of Gaza, which Palestinians have called an indiscriminately targeting of civilians. The Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry said at least 7,028 Palestinians have been killed, including 2,913 children. These claims could not be verified, and the State Department said it had no way to accurately assess the death toll. The House, meanwhile, [passed](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2023/10/25/congress/house-israel-resolution-00123590) a bipartisan resolution that states the U.S. "stands with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists," affirms Israel's right to self-defense, and calls for an immediate halt of violence. And the Pentagon is [deploying](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/26/politics/us-troops-deploying-middle-east/index.html) roughly 900 U.S. troops to the Middle East. None of the troops are going to Israel. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/10/26/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna122266) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/26/israel-war-hamas-gaza-news-palestine/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-10-26-23/index.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-war-palestinians-news) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-26/israel-latest-army-attacks-targets-in-northern-gaza-ground-raid?srnd=premium&sref=MIBMEEoj))

3/ **Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced a resolution to censure Rashida Tlaib**. The measure would censure Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, for alleged “antisemitic activity, sympathizing with terrorist organizations and leading an insurrection" at the Capitol, because she spoke to protestors advocating for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. Tlaib called Greene's resolution "deeply Islamophobic and attacks peaceful Jewish anti-war advocates." Democrats are expected to censure Greene in retaliation for her history of inflammatory rhetoric, including a history of racism, homophobia, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and promotion of conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, other lawmakers are prepping a resolution to expel George Santos, who faces federal charges for wire fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds, lying to Congress, and identity theft. The tit-for-tat comes as the House faces a Nov. 17 deadline to pass a spending measure to avert a government shutdown, as well as consider Biden's request for $106 billion in emergency funds for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and the U.S. border.

4/ **Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has discussed potential plea deals with at least six more Trump co-defendants in the Georgia election subversion case**. Of the 19 defendants in the case, four have accepted a deal, including three attorneys who illegally conspired to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/25/politics/fulton-county-da-is-discussing-plea-deals-with-at-least-5-more-trump-co-defendants/))

5/ **Special counsel Jack Smith asked a judge to reimpose a federal gag order on Trump in the election interference case**, citing Trump's recent comments "targeting a known witness in this case in an attempt to influence and intimidate him." Smith argued that the court should also consider stricter sanctions, including sending him to jail, if Trump keeps talking about witnesses in the case. Trump has “capitalized” on the temporary suspension of his partial gag order to “send an unmistakable and threatening message to a foreseeable witness in this case,” Smith said. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/trump-election-case-jack-smith-wants-gag-order-reimposed.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/25/special-counsel-trump-trial-comments-jail/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/26/trump-meadows-gag-order-smith) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/25/special-counsel-trump-federal-gag-order-00123676))

6/ **A federal judge ordered Georgia to draw new congressional and state legislative maps before 2024**. District Court Judge Steve Jones wrote that the political maps drawn by Republican lawmakers after the last census violate the federal Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting power of Black voters. Jones ordered lawmakers to redraw the congressional map to include an additional majority-Black district, two additional majority-Black state senate districts, and five additional majority-Black state House districts. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-redistricting-voting-rights-3a29f4d5662e8908cc083aa07c37abd4) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/26/1208796830/georgia-redistricting-districts-judge-ruling) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/26/georgia-election-maps-redrawn/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/26/politics/georgia-legislative-maps-order/index.html))

7/ **North Carolina Republicans approved a new congressional map that eliminates roughly half of the Democrats representing the state in the House**. The state’s congressional delegation is currently split 7-7 between the political parties, but the new map divvies up the state's 14 congressional districts into 10 districts that favor Republicans, three that favor Democrats, and one that is considered competitive for both parties. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/us/politics/north-carolina-republicans-gerrymander.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/25/politics/north-carolina-map-republicans/index.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/25/1208002456/north-carolina-redistricting-congressional-districts))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **“The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and it’s unstoppable,”** according to the annual "World Energy Outlook" from the International Energy Agency. “It’s not a question of ‘if’, it’s just a matter of ‘how soon’ — and the sooner the better for all of us.” The agency expects there to be nearly 10 times as many electric cars on the road globally by 2030, and for renewables to account for almost half of the global energy mix – up from 30% today. ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/23930058/forecast-clean-renewable-unstoppable-international-energy-agency) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/energy/iea-oil-gas-coal-demand-peak-2030/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/24/clean-energy-transition-is-unstoppable-iea-says/) / [IEA](https://www.iea.org/news/the-energy-world-is-set-to-change-significantly-by-2030-based-on-today-s-policy-settings-alone))

2. **Collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet is all but "unavoidable,"** according to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. The study found that regardless of how aggressively humans act to reduce fossil fuel emissions, the waters near West Antarctica’s glaciers are forecast to warm at a pace three times faster than they have in the past, which will cause “widespread increases in ice-shelf melting, including in regions crucial for ice-sheet stability." The melt process would likely take several centuries, but a total collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet could contribute about 10 feet to overall sea level rise. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/west-antarctic-ice-sheet-collapse-may-unavoidable-study-finds-rcna120993) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/10/23/sea-live-rise-antarctic-ice-loss/))

3. **In 2023, Earth had at least 38 days that exceeded daily average temperatures of 1.5C** – more than in any other year – according to the annual State of the Climate report. Before 2000, global average daily temperature never went higher than 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. The report concludes that: “Life on planet Earth is under siege.” ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-24/state-of-climate-report-sums-up-extreme-weather-this-year?srnd=premium&sref=MIBMEEoj))

4. **The newly elected House speaker, Mike Johnson, has questioned climate science, opposed clean energy, and accepted campaign contributions from oil and gas companies**. Johnson "has consistently voted against dozens of climate bills and amendments, opposing legislation that would require companies to disclose their risks from climate change and bills that would reduce leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas wells. He has voted for measures that would cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/climate/mike-johnson-climate-policies.html))
