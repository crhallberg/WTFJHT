The Republican-led effort would rewrite many of the state‚Äôs voting regulations, including limiting drop boxes, increasing absentee voter ID requirements, prohibiting distributing food and most beverages to people waiting in line to vote, and stripping the secretary of state of some authority. The 100-75 party-line vote sends the bill to the state Senate where Republican lawmakers are expected to pass the final bill next week before the end of the session. Biden, meanwhile, called efforts to limit voting rights ‚Äúsick‚Äù and ‚Äúun-American," saying he's "worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It's sick. It's sick.‚Äù ([Atlanta Journal-Constitution](https://www.ajc.com/politics/bill-changing-georgia-voting-rules-passes-state-house/EY2MATS6SRA77HTOBVEMTJLIT4/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/us/georgia-voting-rights-bill.html) / [Talking Points Memo](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/georgia-election-overhaul-legislation-passes-house) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/25/biden-gop-voting-laws-478001) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/25/politics/georgia-state-house-voting-bill-passage/index.html))

9/ **Joe Manchin said he had ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù concerns over some of the provisions in the For the People Act**, the most significant federal election and voting rights expansion in a generation. Manchin urged Democrats to take a bipartisan approach, saying "pushing through legislation of this magnitude on a partisan basis may garner short-term benefits, but will inevitably only exacerbate the distrust that millions of Americans harbor against the U.S. government.‚Äù To pass in the Senate, Democrats will likely need to persuade all 50 Democrats to change the filibuster rules to overcome uniform Republican opposition to the legislation. Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, however, have said they are no votes on getting rid of the filibuster. Biden, meanwhile, said the filibuster was being ‚Äúabused in a gigantic way‚Äù and signaled that he could support changing the Senate‚Äôs rules in order to pass key parts of his agenda. "We're going to get a lot done. And if we have to ‚Äî if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we'll have to go beyond" the talking filibuster.
