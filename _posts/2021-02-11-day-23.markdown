### ‚öñÔ∏è Trump‚Äôs Second Senate Impeachment Trial: Day 3.

**What happened today?** The House impeachment managers prosecuting Trump rested their case, saying that if Trump is not convicted, it sets "a new terrible standard for presidential misconduct." The managers used their final day of arguments to show how the insurrectionists ‚Äì using his specific words ‚Äì carried out the attack on the Capitol at Trump's direction, warning that Trump could incite more violence if not convicted. The managers also focused on Trump's history of celebrating violence and his lack of remorse following the Jan. 6 insurrection to demonstrate why he should be convicted and barred from holding federal office again. ‚ÄúSenators, America, we need to exercise our common sense about what happened,‚Äù Rep. Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, said in his final arguments. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not get caught up in a lot of outlandish lawyers‚Äô theories here. Exercise your common sense about what just took place in our country.‚Äù

**What‚Äôs next?** Trump's defense team will begin their arguments tomorrow against conviction. Trump‚Äôs defense is not [expected](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/11/trump-impeachment-defense-friday-468694) to use all 16 hours of their allotted time for presentations and instead plans finish its arguments in the Senate's impeachment trial by Friday night. A verdict could come as early as the weekend. Democrats are looking for at least 17 Senate Republicans to join them in voting to convict Trump.
