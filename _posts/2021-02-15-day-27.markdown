  vote to acquit, House impeachment managers unexpectedly called for witnesses after
  Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told her that
  Trump supported the mob in a phone call as the Jan. 6 attack was unfolding; Mitch

  of a "disgraceful dereliction of duty"; Trump celebrated his acquittal, calling
  the proceedings "yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt" perpetuated against

  9/11-style commission to investigate why government officials and law enforcement
  failed to stop the attack on the U.S. Capitol.

1/ **Trump was acquitted for the second time in 13 months**. The Senate voted 57-43 Saturday in favor of convicting Trump ‚Äì one month and a week after insurrectionists incited a riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6 ‚Äì¬†10 votes short of the required two-thirds majority necessary for conviction. Republicans Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, and Patrick Toomey joined all 50 Democrats in voting to find Trump guilty of ‚Äúincitement of insurrection‚Äù ‚Äì¬†the largest number of senators to vote to find a president of their own party guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. Trump is also the only U.S. president to have been impeached twice. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-acquitted-impeachment-riot/2021/02/13/dbf6b172-6e12-11eb-ba56-d7e2c8defa31_story.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/b245b52fd7d4a079ae199c954baba452) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/13/trump-impeachment-trial-day-5-468985) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-donald-trump-acquitted/story?id=75853994))

* **üëë Six hours of paralysis: Inside Trump‚Äôs failure to act after a mob stormed the Capitol**. ‚ÄúHe was hard to reach, and you know why? Because it was live TV,‚Äù said one close Trump adviser. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs TiVo, he just hits pause and takes the calls. If it‚Äôs live TV, he watches it, and he was just watching it all unfold.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-mob-failure/2021/01/11/36a46e2e-542e-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html))

* **üëë One Legacy of Impeachment: The most complete account so far of Jan. 6**. "Though Mr. Trump escaped conviction, the Senate impeachment trial has served at least one purpose: It stitched together the most comprehensive and chilling account to date of last month‚Äôs deadly assault on the Capitol, ensuring that the former president‚Äôs name will be inextricably associated with a violent attempt to subvert the peaceful transfer of power, the first in American history." ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/us/politics/capitol-riots-impeachment-trial.html))

2/ **Before the vote to acquit, House impeachment managers unexpectedly called for witnesses after Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told her that Trump supported the mob in a phone call as the Jan. 6 attack was unfolding**. Herrera Beutler said that McCarthy had relayed the details of his call with Trump to her, and that McCarthy asked Trump ‚Äúto publicly and forcefully call off the riot.‚Äù Trump, instead, reportedly told McCarthy: "Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are." House impeachment managers seized on her [account](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/12/politics/trump-mccarthy-shouting-match-details/index.html), saying they wanted to subpoena her as a witness. The Senate then voted to call witnesses, which was reversed a few hours later after a deal to allow her statement read into the record. Trump‚Äôs attorney also threatened to seek depositions from 100 or more witnesses, which would have delayed Biden's agenda by dragging out the trial.

3/ **Mitch McConnell denounced Trump minutes after voting to acquit, saying Trump was guilty of a "disgraceful dereliction of duty."** In his post-acquittal speech, McConnell said that Trump was ‚Äúmorally and practically responsible for provoking‚Äù the Jan. 6 insurrection, but said he is ‚Äúconstitutionally not eligible for conviction‚Äù because he is no longer in office. The Senate trial occurred after Trump left office because McConnell said he would not call back the Senate before lawmakers were set to return Jan. 19 unless every senator agreed to do so. The House impeached Trump on Jan. 13. McConnell also suggested that Trump could still face criminal liability, saying "The Constitution makes perfectly clear that Presidential criminal misconduct while in office can be prosecuted after the President has left office," adding that Trump ‚Äúdidn't get away with anything yet.‚Äù House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, called it ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù for McConnell to have ‚Äúkept the Senate shut down‚Äù and unable to receive the article of impeachment. Pelosi added that the 43 Republicans who voted to acquit Trump are "a cowardly group \[...\] who apparently have no options, because they were afraid to defend their job, respect the institution in which they serve.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/us/mcconnell-trump-impeachment-acquittal.html) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/13/mitch-mcconnell-says-trump-caused-capitol-riot-but-votes-acquit/4476982001/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/after-acquitting-trump-mcconnell-slams-him-disgraceful-dereliction-duty-n1257900) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/13/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates/#link-WVSW4J5WT5BBHOV6ONIHCU4OKM))

4/ **Trump celebrated the Senate voting to acquit him of inciting an insurrection minutes after the verdict was announced, calling the proceedings "yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt" perpetuated against him by "one political party."** Trump suggested that the Democrats‚Äô attempt to end his political career had failed, saying ‚Äúour historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun.‚Äù Lindsey Graham [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-14/trump-alive-and-well-as-republican-party-force-senator-says?srnd=politics-vp&sref=MIBMEEoj) Trump remains the party‚Äôs ‚Äúmost potent force‚Äù even after his second impeachment and that ‚Äúthe Trump movement is alive and well." Trump, however, has [reportedly](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/13/politics/trump-concern-charges-january-6/index.html) voiced concern about being charged related to Jan. 6 riot.

5/ **Lawmakers in both parties called for a bipartisan 9/11-style commission to investigate why government officials and law enforcement failed to stop the attack on the U.S. Capitol**. In a letter to House Democrats, Nancy Pelosi said "our next step will be to establish an outside, independent 9/11-type Commission to 'investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex.'" A commission is the primary remaining option for Congress to try to hold Trump accountable for his role in the assault. Separately, two Senate committees will investigate security failures during the riots, and Nancy Pelosi has also asked the House for a review of the Capitol‚Äôs security process.
