1/ **A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” program**, which attempted to shrink the federal workforce by offering employees months of pay in exchange for resignation. The decision came hours before the midnight deadline for workers to accept the offer. The judge scheduled a Monday hearing to consider whether to extend the pause. Unions representing federal employees argued the plan is illegal, lacks congressional authorization, pressures workers into resigning under threat of layoffs, and has caused “sheer chaos.” So far, more than 50,000 federal employees – about 2% of the workforce – have accepted the offer. The buyout, overseen by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, was announced in a mass email titled “Fork in the Road,” echoing Musk’s approach during his Twitter takeover. Critics say the administration is using the program to purge career employees and replace them with political appointees. The Trump administration, meanwhile, called the "buyout" a "a rare, generous opportunity."

* **The Education Department told staff that the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” offer could be canceled at any time**, leaving employees without promised pay or recourse. A sample agreement showed that workers must waive their right to challenge cancellations. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/buyout-trump-offer-workforce-resignation-musk-doge-opm-education-rcna190881))
* **The Trump administration is preparing an executive order to cut thousands of jobs at the Department of Health and Human Services, including positions at the CDC and FDA**. The order, which could be issued next week, would require federal health agencies to reduce staff and agencies have been directed to categorize probationary employees by necessity. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/white-house-preparing-order-to-cut-thousands-of-federal-health-workers-bd1e0b7f) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/06/health-agencies-rank-probationary-employees/))

2/ **Senate Democrats held an all-night protest against Russell Vought’s confirmation as director of the Office of Management and Budget**, citing his role in Project 2025 and efforts to consolidate executive power. Democrats condemned Vought’s influence in freezing federal grant funding, which disrupted programs like Head Start. Despite their opposition, Republicans advanced his nomination anyway in a 53-47 party-line vote, with final confirmation expected Thursday night. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called Vought’s confirmation a “disaster for working families,” while Republican leaders praised his experience in cutting government spending. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/06/russell-vought-democrats-protest-trump) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/trump-senate-democrats-russell-vought.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russ-vought-senate-confirmation-vote-office-of-management-and-budget/))

3/ **Senate Democrats delayed a committee vote on Kash Patel’s nomination as FBI director**, citing concerns over his loyalty to Trump and past statements about purging FBI leadership. Patel, who never served as an FBI agent, also refused to discuss his grand jury testimony in Trump’s classified documents case, invoking the Fifth Amendment. Democrats demanded a second hearing, arguing Patel's evasiveness and ties to far-right groups disqualify him. Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, however, denied the request, calling Patel a fighter against corruption. The full Senate is expected to vote on his nomination next week. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/06/congress/kash-patel-fbi-confirmation-00202842) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/06/trump-presidency-news/#link-7QV6JSZG6BCEXKVM4POQPWCPZE) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/committee-vote-kash-patels-nomination-fbi-director-delayed/story?id=118527085))

4/ **The Justice Department sued Chicago, Cook County, and Illinois over their "sanctuary laws" that limit cooperation with immigration authorities**. The lawsuit claims the Chicago's sanctuary laws "interfere with and discriminate against" federal immigration enforcement in violation of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker defended the state's policies, saying "unlike Donald Trump, Illinois follows the law [...] We look forward to seeing them in court." Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson reaffirmed the city’s "police department will not intervene or participate in any way."  Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, announced plans to withhold federal grants from Chicago police and prosecute local officials who defy federal immigration enforcement. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/06/nx-s1-5288871/justice-department-sues-chicago-and-illinois-over-sanctuary-laws) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/06/trump-illinois-chicago-immigration-lawsuit) / [Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/02/pam-bondi-trump-doj-memo-prosecute-dei-companies.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/attorney-general-pam-bondi-review-trump-prosecutions-sanctuary-cities/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/06/justice-dept-chicago-illinois-lawsuit/))
 
5/ **Trump will sign an executive order imposing financial and visa sanctions on International Criminal Court**, accusing officials of improperly targeting the U.S. and Israel. The order follows the ICC’s issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over war crimes in Gaza, including using starvation as a weapon of war, and for “murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.” The White House accused the ICC of creating a “shameful moral equivalency” between Israel and Hamas. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-executive-order-sanctioning-international-criminal-court-rcna191018) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-impose-sanctions-international-criminal-court-2025-02-06/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/06/trump-presidency-news/#link-BFEJDGFT6BCM5PB7E4GN3KBZGY))

6/ **Trump announced the formation of a Justice Department-led task force to investigate "anti-Christian bias" in the federal government**. Attorney General Pam Bondi will lead the initiative to target agencies like the DOJ, FBI, and IRS. Trump also established a White House faith office, led by pastor Paula White-Cain, and a presidential commission on religious liberty. At the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump said his faith deepened after surviving assassination attempts and urged Americans to “bring God back.” ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-prayer-breakfast-30ff6f55a2e3c7b8643a15e7b158537d) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/06/trump-task-force-christian-religious/78286967007/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5130103-trump-national-prayer-breakfast-religious-discrimination-task-force-anti-christian-bias/))

### 🧐 WTF is Elon Musk doing?  

**Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency gained access to the Treasury payments system, Medicare databases, and federal personnel records**, triggering lawsuits and a partial court-ordered restriction. DOGE’s expansion has led to [fears of privacy violations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-access-personnel-data-opm-security/), unauthorized financial control, and conflicts of interest, as Musk’s companies, like SpaceX and Tesla, hold billions in government contracts. Nevertheless, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt [reassured](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/white-house-says-musk-will-police-his-own-conflicts-of-interest) Americans that “If Elon Musk comes across a conflict of interest [...] Elon will excuse himself. ”The Justice Department also [agreed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-administration-agrees-restrict-doge-access-treasury-department-p-rcna190898) to temporarily restrict DOG staffers from accessing information in the Treasury Department’s payment system.

Meanwhile, a [judge temporarily blocked DOGE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/treasury-access-by-musk-s-doge-partly-limited-by-judge-for-now) from altering Treasury payment records after [leaked emails](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/06/politics/elon-musk-treasury-department-payment-system/index.html) revealed Musk’s team [intention to freeze](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/us/politics/trump-musk-usaid.html) USAID foreign aid. Trump administration, however, will [reduce the number of workers](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/06/us/president-trump-news#usaid-job-cuts) at the U.S. Agency for International Development from more than 10,000 to about 290 positions worldwide. The court order followed lawsuits from federal employee unions accusing DOGE of unlawfully accessing sensitive government data, including Social Security numbers and personnel files.

Musk and DOGE have [gained access to Medicare and Medicaid systems](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-aides-search-medicare-agency-payment-systems-fraud-wsj-reports-2025-02-05/), which he [said](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-health-data-cms) "is where the big money fraud is happening.” While the White House insists DOGE is simply identifying inefficiencies.

DOGE is also [deploying AI to identify spending cuts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/), starting with the Education Department, where it accessed federal student loan data and sidelined over 100 employees who had attended diversity, equity, and inclusion training. “That’s the way you kill an agency – you remove all their ability to perform their role,” one government official said, as Musk’s signaled plans to expand AI-driven reviews across multiple agencies.

Musk is also [taking on air traffic control modernization](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-says-doge-will-make-rapid-safety-upgrades-on-air-traffic-control-2000560019) after a midair collision over Washington, D.C. killed 67 people. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy [confirmed](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/06/trump-air-traffic-system-00202831) DOGE’s involvement, saying they would “plug in to help upgrade our aviation system.” However, lawmakers expressed concerns about Musk’s influence over FAA regulations, given SpaceX’s history of regulatory "challenges" regarding launch license violations, safety data submission, environmental compliance, and criticism of bureaucratic inefficiencies. “Musk poses a clear conflict of interest," Sen. Maria Cantwell said, "he should not be part of the FAA air transportation system."

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **Trump promoted a conspiracy theory that claims the federal government pays “billions of dollars” to news outlets for positive cover of Democrats**. Trump claimed that Politico, a “left wing rag,” had received $8 million, and questioned if The New York Times and other outlets had also "stolen" payments. In reality, federal agencies have paid Politico, New York Times, and other news media sites for products and subscriptions. Nevertheless, the White House directed the General Services Administration to cancel "every single media contract."
