1/ **Mitch McConnell will oppose legislation to create a commission tasked with investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol**, making it clear that the legislation will likely not have the votes to get through the Senate. McConnell called the proposal to create a bipartisan commission – with an equal number of Republicans and Democrats – "slanted and unbalanced." Following McConnell’s remarks, Sen. Mike Rounds, who had previously expressed support for the commission, said he no longer backed the proposal. While the bill is expected to pass the House, the measure will need 10 Senate GOP votes to even start debate and allow amendments. The House is scheduled to vote on the bill today.

2/ **The New York attorney general's office opened a criminal investigation into the Trump Organization**, in addition to its ongoing civil probe. New York Attorney General Letitia James' office will join Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's office in the criminal investigation, saying: “We have informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the organization is no longer purely civil in nature. We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity, along with the Manhattan DA.” The two offices have been conducting parallel investigations for more than a year: James' investigation had been a civil one, while Vance's had been a criminal investigation. Both probes have focused on whether the Trump Organization and Trump deliberately inflated the value of assets and while downplaying property values for tax benefits in financial filings. Separately, Trump is also facing a criminal investigation in Georgia over whether he improperly tried to influence election officials last year. Trump, meanwhile, [called](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-calls-new-york-criminal-investigation-corrupt-desperate-search-crime-n1267939) the criminal probe of his company "corrupt" and "in desperate search of a crime."

3/ **Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law legislation that prohibits abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected**, effectively banning most abortions in the state before many women know they are pregnant. The bill also allows any citizen to file a civil lawsuit against abortion providers, and anybody who “aids or abets” the performance of the procedure. The bill includes an exception for medical emergencies, but not for pregnancies that resulted from rape or incest. The law takes effect in September.

4/ **Tennessee will require businesses and government facilities to post a sign indicating that they allow transgender people to use their bathrooms**, locker rooms or changing rooms associated with their gender identity. Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed the first-of-its-kind bill Monday, which LGBTQ advocacy groups called “offensive and humiliating.” Lee also signed a bill that opens public schools up to lawsuits if they allow transgender students or staff use bathrooms or locker room that match their gender identity. The bill defines a person's sex as "a person's immutable biological sex as determined by anatomy and genetics existing at the time of birth" and requires students and staff at public schools to only use a multi-occupancy bathroom or changing room with other people of the same "biological sex." In addition, Lee also signed a transgender sports bill into law in March that requires students prove their sex at birth in order to play school sports.

5/ **U.S. Capitol Police are conducting a criminal investigation related to a subpoena for information about a parody Twitter account dedicated to mocking Rep. Devin Nunes**. The disclosure by the Capitol Police came a day [after](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2021/05/18/day-119/#5-trump%E2%80%99s-justice-department-used-a) the Justice Department revealed that Trump’s Justice Department had used a secret grand jury subpoena in an attempt to identify the person behind the @NunesAlt account. The investigation, which is still open, reportedly involves a threat made online.  Prosecutors, however, declined to identify anything specific that @NunesAlt had posted that was threatening, according to unsealed documents.

6/ **The FBI is investigating a scheme to illegally finance Sen. Susan Collins' 2020 re-election bid**. The FBI believes a U.S. defense contractor illegally donated $150,000 to a super PAC for the Maine Republican, and then reimbursed family members for donations to Collins' campaign. There's no indication that Collins or her team were aware of the allegedly illegal donations.
