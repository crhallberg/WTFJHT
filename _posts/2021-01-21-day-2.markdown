1/ **Biden marked the start of his presidency by signing or finalizing 17 executive orders, memorandums, and proclamations to roll back some of Trump's policies**. Hours after his inauguration, Biden began signing orders on a range of issues, which included defunding the construction of Trump's border wall, reversing Trump's travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, ending the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the Census, recommitting to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, revoking the permit for the [Keystone XL oil pipeline](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/20/joe-biden-kills-keystone-xl-pipeline-permit-460555), and [rejoining the Paris climate agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/climate/biden-paris-climate-agreement.html). "There's no time to start like today," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office as he began signing. "I'm going to start by keeping the promises I made to the American people." Biden also signed an order appointing Jeffrey Zients as his Covid-19 response coordinator who will report to the president, in an effort to ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù gear up the nation‚Äôs response to the Covid-19 pandemic. One of Biden's top advisers described the flurry of executive authority as an effort to ‚Äúreverse the gravest damages‚Äù done to the country by Trump.

2/ **Biden, pledging a ‚Äúfull-scale wartime effort‚Äù to combat the coronavirus, signed at least 10 executive orders and directives on his second day in office aimed at addressing the pandemic**. Biden's national strategy will address testing, treating, and vaccinating people for Covid-19 by ordering federal agencies to invoke the Defense Production Act to boost the manufacture of necessary supplies of masks, gowns, gloves, rapid test kits, testing agents and material for vaccines. Biden will also require travelers to wear masks on planes, trains, buses, and at airports, as well as require a negative Covid-19 test before flying to the U.S. Other orders and directives will create a public dashboard with real-time national and state-level data on cases, testing, vaccinations, and hospitalizations, deploy FEMA to set up 100 community vaccination sites in the next 30 days, and create a Covid-19 Health Equity Task Force to ‚Äúaddress the disproportionate and severe impact of Covid-19 on communities of color and other underserved populations."

3/ **Biden reversed Trump's move to leave the World Health Organization** ‚Äì exactly one year after the United States recorded its first Covid-19 case. "I am honored to announce that the United States will remain a member of the World Health Organization," Dr. Anthony Fauci told U.N.'s health agency. Dr. Fauci said the U.S. would re-engage at all levels and would join Covax, a program to distribute vaccines to poorer nations. The agency‚Äôs director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, thanks Biden and Dr. Fauci  for recommitting to the Covid-19 fight, saying: "This is a good day for the WHO and a good day for global health.‚Äù ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/21/959142553/u-s-will-remain-in-who-fauci-announces-as-biden-reverses-trump-move) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/21/world/covid-19-coronavirus/fauci-who-covid) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/fauci-coronavirus-biden-trump-who/2021/01/21/22467be6-5bce-11eb-a849-6f9423a75ffd_story.html))

4/ **The Biden administration identified 12 ‚Äúimmediate supply shortfalls‚Äù in the Trump administration‚Äôs pandemic response plans, including a nonexistent coronavirus vaccine distribution plan**. Biden called the vaccine rollout "a dismal failure thus far,‚Äù adding ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt get into this mess overnight,‚Äù and that "things are going to continue to get worse before they get better." The shortfalls identified by the Biden team include a lack of N95 surgical masks and isolation gowns, swabs, reagents and pipettes used in testing. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre inheriting from the Trump administration is so much worse than we could have imagined,‚Äù Jeff Zients, the Biden administration‚Äôs Covid-19 czar, said in a call. ‚ÄúWe don't have the visibility that we would hope to have into supply and allocations.‚Äù Meanwhile, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the new director of the CDC, warned that the Covid-19 vaccine would not be widely available by late February, as the Trump administration previously promised. The CDC also expects the U.S. to see another 100,000 or more Covid-19 deaths by next month, bringing the death toll to 508,000 by February 13. Dr. Anthony Fauci added that his ‚Äúbest-case scenario‚Äù is getting 85% of Americans vaccinated by the end of summer.

5/ **Around 900,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week**. While down slightly from last week, jobless claims remain above the pre-pandemic peak of 695,000. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/21/jobless-claims-decline-january-461044) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/first-weekly-initial-jobless-claims-biden-era-fall-900-000-n1255036) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-01-21-2021-11611181914))

6/ **Senate Republicans refused to agree to a power-sharing agreement unless Democrats promised to preserve the filibuster**. Mitch McConnell has pressed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to keep the 60-vote threshold on most legislation as part of their agreement. Democrats, however, have rejected the proposal, saying it would be a mistake to take the filibuster off the table now that they're in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House for the first time in more than a decade. The stalemate is slowing down confirmation of Biden's nominees, Trump's impeachment trial, and more.

 1. **House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was "ready" to transmit the House‚Äôs impeachment charge against Trump to the Senate ‚Äúsoon,‚Äù** declining to provide an exact date for doing so.

 2. **The Biden administration is seeking a five-year extension to its nuclear arms treaty with Russia, which expires Feb.‚Äâ5**.

 6. **The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a waiver for Lloyd Austin's nomination for defense secretary**.
