1/ **The Justice Department identified "a limited set" of documents seized from Mar-a-Lago that are potentially covered by attorney-client privilege**. The disclosure that a Justice Department "filter team" had completed its review of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago came as Trump’s lawyers pressed a federal judge two weeks after the Aug. 8 search to appoint a special master to review the documents. The filter team is separate from the team involved in the criminal investigation and "is in the process of following the procedures” spelled out in the search warrant to handle any privilege disputes.

2/ **A heavily redacted copy of the FBI affidavit used to justify the search of Mar-a-Lago revealed that 14 of the 15 boxes Trump returned in January contained 184 documents with classification markings**, including 25 marked “top secret,” 92 marked “secret,” and 67 marked “confidential.” Several of the documents contained Trump’s “handwritten notes,” some were related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and not meant to be shared with foreign nations, and others refer to the systems used to protect intelligence gathered from secret human sources. The National Archives referred the matter to the Justice Department on Feb. 9 after finding what they described as “a lot of classified records.” The Justice Department wrote in its request for the search that there is “probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found” at Trump’s house.

3/ **The U.S. intelligence community will conduct a damage assessment of the possible risks to national security stemming from Trump’s handling of the top-secret documents stored at Mar-a-Lago**. In the letter to the House Intelligence and Oversight Committees, Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, informed the lawmakers that her office would lead an “assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents.” Haines added that the DNI and Justice Department are "working together to facilitate a classification review of relevant materials, including those recovered during the search."
