1/ **The Justice Department fired more than a dozen officials who worked on criminal investigations into Trump**. Acting Attorney General James McHenry stated the officials could not be “trusted” to “faithfully” implement Trump’s agenda, calling the action “consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.” The firings targeted prosecutors involved in special counsel Jack Smith’s now-dismissed cases against Trump, which addressed classified documents and Jan. 6 election interference. The DOJ did not disclose the names or number of those dismissed. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-administration-fires-doj-officials-worked-criminal-investigation-rcna189512) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/politics/trump-special-project-january-6-prosecutors/index.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/27/doj-firings-trump-jack-smith-officials/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/us/politics/chief-corruption-prosecutor.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-special-counsel-trump-046ce32dbad712e72e500c32ecc20f2f) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/doj-fires-officials-involved-in-trump-prosecutions.html))

2/ **Trump-appointed acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin ordered a review of Jan. 6 obstruction charges**, citing a Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the statute's scope. Martin instructed his office to hand over all files, documents, and notes related to the use of the federal obstruction statute in charging Capitol rioters. This move followed a Supreme Court ruling that limited the statute's application, deeming its broader use in these cases excessive. Martin called the use of the statute a "failure" and appointed senior prosecutors to lead a “special project” investigating the matter. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-appointed-prosecutor-opens-review-of-justice-departments-jan-6-cases-72cd371c) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/27/edward-martin-us-attorney-jan6/))

* **Senate Democrats introduced a resolution condemning Trump’s pardons for violent Jan. 6 rioters**, focusing on those who assaulted Capitol Police officers. Trump’s pardons covered all 1,600 defendants, including over 600 charged with assaulting law enforcement. Lindsey Graham criticized the pardons, calling the decision "a mistake" and warned they could encourage future violence, while JD Vance defended Trump’s actions as correcting “unfair” treatment by the DOJ. The Justice Department, meanwhile, removed its online database of Jan. 6 criminal cases following Trump’s pardons for about 1,600 Capitol rioters. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/27/congress/senate-dems-jan-6-pardons-00200696) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-resolution-trump-rioter-pardons-john-fetterman_n_67979a24e4b0e33f6ee66c72) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/25/politics/january-6-justice-department-database/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/us/politics/trump-pardons-jan-6-lindsey-graham.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/lindsey-graham-trump-pardoning-violent-jan-6-defendant-mistake-rcna189322))

3/ **Trump fired at least 12 federal inspectors general**, bypassing legal requirements for congressional notice. On Friday night, Trump dismissed inspectors general from over a dozen federal agencies, including Defense, State, and Energy, claiming "changing priorities" as justification. Federal law mandates 30 days’ notice to Congress before such firings, but no advance notification was given. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democratic leaders criticized the move, warning it undermines government accountability. Trump defended the firings as "a common thing to do," stating he plans to replace the watchdogs with qualified individuals. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/25/politics/trump-fires-inspectors-general/index.html) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/politics/trump-fires-inspectors-general.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/25/trump-fires-inspectors-general) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/24/trump-fire-inspectors-general-federal-agencies/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/25/donald-trump-inspectors-general-firing-00200611))

4/ **The Trump administration initiated large-scale immigration enforcement operations in Chicago and other cities, leading to nearly 1,000 arrests nationwide**. Trump has directed ICE officials to arrest 1,200 to 1,500 people a day. ICE averaged 311 daily arrests last year. The Justice Department confirmed that multiple agencies, including ICE, FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Marshals, participated in the “enhanced targeted operations.” Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove called the operations a necessary response to a “national emergency” caused by “failed immigration policy.” While officials emphasized a focus on individuals with criminal records, “collateral arrests” of undocumented immigrants without records also occurred, raising fears in immigrant communities. Immigrant advocacy groups, meanwhile, filed lawsuits to challenge the raids, citing constitutional violations and accusing the administration of punitive actions against sanctuary cities. The administration, however, defended the raids as necessary to “protect the homeland” and stated that similar operations would continue nationwide. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/26/us/politics/chicago-deportation-emil-bove-trump.html) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/politics/immigration-raids-federal-agents-uniform/index.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276139/trump-immigration-border-orders-blueprint) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/immigration-enforcement-operations-rcna189353) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/26/ice-arrests-raids-trump-quota/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-deportations-chicago-immigration-arrests-cfb20a3e412443aa2ca6c6ed4d1070d4) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/acting-deputy-attorney-general-emil-bove-chicago-immigration/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/27/immigrant-arrests-ice-raids-trump-administration))

* **Secret Service agents investigating a threat against a government official attempted to visit Hamline Elementary School on Chicago's South Side but were denied entry by staff following district protocols designed to protect immigrant families**. Chicago Public Schools initially believed the agents were from ICE, citing identification from the Department of Homeland Security, but later clarified that this was a misunderstanding. Hamline Elementary, a predominantly Latino school with a high number of English learners, implemented a soft lockdown during the encounter, which CPS stated demonstrated its preparedness to safeguard students. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/us/ice-agents-attempt-entry-into-chicago-elementary-school/index.html) / [NBC Chicago](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/ice-agents-showed-up-at-chicago-school-amid-heightened-concerns-of-raids/3655459/) / [ABC7 Chicago](https://abc7chicago.com/post/us-immigration-customs-enforcement-agents-denied-entry-hamline-elementary-school-back-yards-cps-officials/15833738/) / [Chalkbeat Chicago](https://www.chalkbeat.org/chicago/2025/01/24/ice-agents-show-up-to-hamline-elementary-cps/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/24/ice-agents-chicago-hamline-elementary-school) / [Block Club Chicago](https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/01/24/ice-agents-denied-entry-at-cps-school-in-back-of-the-yards/))

5/ **Colombia agreed to accept deported migrants after Trump threatened 25% tariffs, visa sanctions, and trade penalties**. After initially denying entry to two U.S. military deportation flights, Colombia said it would accept the deported nationals with “dignified conditions” and offered its presidential plane for transport. "We will receive our countrymen on commercial planes, without them being treated like criminals," Colombian President Gustavo Petro said. Trump’s retaliatory measures, including tariffs that could have risen to 50%, were paused but "will be held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/colombia-turns-away-deportation-flights-rcna189335) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/colombia-immigration-deportation-flights-petro-trump-us-67870e41556c5d8791d22ec6767049fd) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/trump-says-colombia-will-face-25-tariffs-amid-fight-over-deportation-flights-e32dc497))

* **Mexico blocked a U.S. military deportation flight**. The flight never departed, but officials said four non-military deportation flights were later accepted. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/mexico-refuses-accept-us-deportation-flight-rcna189182))

* **Trump is considering 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada starting February 1** to pressure them on migration, trade, and border security. Both nations warned of economic fallout and prepared retaliation, while officials expressed frustration over unclear U.S. demands and limited dialogue. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/trump-aides-want-to-hit-mexico-canada-with-tariffs-before-talks-3ff27f14))

6/ **Trump proposed relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries, calling for Jordan and Egypt to accept refugees as part of a plan to “clean out” Gaza**. The plan was condemned by Jordan, Egypt, and Palestinian leaders, who described it as forced displacement and a violation of international law. Trump suggested the relocation could be temporary or permanent and offered to work with Arab nations to build housing for Palestinians elsewhere. Egypt and Jordan, however, rejected the proposal outright. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said “Egypt’s stance is clear: it cannot be part of any solution that involves the transfer of Palestinians into Sinai.” Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi added: “Our rejection of the displacement of Palestinians is firm and will not change.” ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/trumps-clean-out-gaza-proposal-stuns-all-sides-scrambles-middle-east-diplomacy-70bab827) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/26/g-s1-44831/trump-jordan-egypt-accept-more-refugees-just-clean-out-gaza) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/26/trump-gaza-palestinians-egypt-jordan) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/26/trump-clean-out-gaza-egypt-jordan-refugees/) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/trump-resumes-sending-2000-pound-bombs-to-israel-undoing-biden-pause))

### ✏️ Notables.

*Quick hits of lesser importance*.

 1. **The Justice Department will limit federal prosecution of antiabortion protesters under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act**, reserving cases for “extraordinary circumstances” such as death, serious harm, or significant property damage. Less severe actions, like blocking clinic entrances, will be left to state or local authorities. Chad Mizelle, DOJ chief of staff, said the policy reflects Trump’s directive to end the “weaponization” of law enforcement. The department dropped three pending cases involving antiabortion activists and Trump pardoned 23 protesters convicted under the law, describing them as “peaceful pro-life protesters.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/24/face-act-prosecutions-trump-justice-department/))

 2. **An Idaho House committee advanced a resolution urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges**, the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, and return marriage regulation to the states. The Republican resolution calls Obergefell an “illegitimate overreach” and seeks to restore marriage as “a union of one man and one woman.” Idaho voters approved a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in 2006, which was invalidated by Obergefell. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/idaho-same-sex-marriage-supreme-court.html))

 3. **The Trump administration ordered the CDC to stop working with the World Health Organization immediately**. CDC staff were directed to cease participation in WHO working groups, advisory boards, and other collaborations, including visits to WHO offices. ([ABC News](https://apnews.com/article/cdc-who-trump-548cf18b1c409c7d22e17311ccdfe1f6))

 4. **Trump proposed eliminating FEMA**, calling for states to manage disasters directly. While pledging federal aid to wildfire- and hurricane-hit areas, he also pushed reforms like water policy changes, drawing criticism from disaster experts and state leaders. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/24/trump-recommends-ending-fema-ahead-of-california-fire-site-visit.html) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-get-rid-of-fema-disaster-relief_n_6793c9abe4b0a839b98bb076) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/nx-s1-5273606/trump-visit-asheville-california-disasters) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-24/trump-questions-fema-s-future-just-when-la-needs-it-most))

 5. **Trump signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America** and reverting Alaska’s Denali to its former name, Mount McKinley. The updated names will apply to federal use, though other nations, including Mexico, are not required to recognize the new gulf designation. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski criticized the Denali decision, calling it a disregard for Native Alaskan traditions and their history with the mountain. The Gulf renaming follows months of speculation and pushback from Mexico, whose president said “North America should be renamed ‘Mexican America.’” ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/interior-department-gulf-of-mexico-america/))

 6. **Trump reiterated his desire to purchase Greenland, calling it a potential security asset for "the free world," and suggested that Canada could benefit from becoming a U.S. state**. Trump claimed Greenland's people “want to be with us” and said resistance from Denmark would be “unfriendly.” On Canada, Trump criticized trade policies and proposed statehood as a solution, arguing Canadians would see lower taxes and increased security. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dismissed the idea, saying it would “not happen.” ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/26/nx-s1-5275375/trump-greenland-canada-israel-gaza))

 7. **Pete Hegseth was confirmed as defense secretary in a 51-50 vote**, with JD Vance breaking the tie after three Republican senators joined Democrats in opposing the controversial nominee. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and Army veteran, faced criticism for allegations of misconduct, including sexual assault, public drunkenness, and financial mismanagement – all of which he denied. Despite opposition from Republicans like Mitch McConnell, who questioned Hegseth's qualifications, the Senate approved him following assurances from Republican holdouts. Hegseth pledged to "revive the warrior ethos" and support Trump’s "peace through strength" agenda. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/24/us/pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-vote) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-vote-confirm-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-rcna189058) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/24/hegseth-senate-confirmation-vote/))

 8. **The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security**. Noem, the former South Dakota governor, pledged to reinstate Trump-era measures like “Remain in Mexico.” Seven Senate Democrats joined Republicans in supporting Noem. Noem’s confirmation follows those of Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Pete Hegseth as defense secretary. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/25/kristi-noem-confirmed-homeland-security-00002088) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/25/kristi-noem-dhs/))

 9. **Trump is expected to sign executive orders reinstating a ban on transgender military service and dismantling DEI programs in the armed forces**. The executive orders restrict enlisting, medical care, and gender-affirming facilities while eliminating DEI offices in key federal agencies. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-executive-order-transgender-military-dei-rcna189470))

10. **Democrats accused Trump of failing to address food prices as promised**, with egg costs rising 36.8% in a year. Trump defended his efforts, while VP JD Vance admitted changes would take time. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/democrats-slam-trump-not-making-good-promise-lower-food-prices-rcna189179) / [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jd-vance-snaps-at-cbs-host-as-hes-grilled-on-lowering-grocery-prices-going-to-take-a-little-bit-of-time/))

11. **Democrats are considering leveraging the debt ceiling to counter Trump’s agenda and push for long-term reforms**, reversing the Republican’s traditional use of the debt limit as a negotiating tool. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/27/trump-debt-ceiling-democrats/))

12. **The CIA now assesses that COVID-19 "most likely" originated from a laboratory leak in Wuhan, China, but assigns "low confidence" to this conclusion**. The updated assessment, based on existing intelligence, was declassified and released under CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who has long favored the lab leak theory. The agency noted that both lab-related and natural origins remain plausible, with no new intelligence tipping the scale definitively. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/cia-shifts-assessment-covid-origins-saying-lab-leak-likely-caused-outb-rcna189284) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/covid-cia-trump-china-pandemic-lab-leak-9ab7e84c626fed68ca13c8d2e453dde1) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-25/cia-shifts-view-on-covid-19-cause-with-lab-leak-as-more-likely) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/us/politics/cia-covid-lab-leak.html) / [CNN](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/25/cia-covid-19-lab-00200618))

13. **Trump revoked security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci, John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, and others, despite ongoing death threats linked to their public roles under his administration**. The move is part of Trump’s broader effort to punish perceived disloyalty, with Trump defending the decision as necessary to avoid indefinite government-funded protection. Trump also rescinded the security clearances of 50 former intelligence officials who criticized him in the past, claiming they undermined U.S. institutions. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trumps-canceling-scores-security-clearances-unprecedented-rcna189245) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/politics/anthony-fauci-security-detail-trump/) / [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-security-details-death-threats-retribution-1235246450/))

14. **At a rally for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany party, Elon Musk called for the country to "move beyond" the “past guilt” over the atrocities of Germany’s Nazi era**. Musk’s remarks come days after his stiff-armed Nazi salute during Trump’s inauguration celebrations – and just before International Holocaust Remembrance Day. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/europe/musk-germany-afd-auschwitz.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/25/musk-german-afd-rally-weidel-00200620) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/elon-musk-appears-video-german-far-right-campaign-event-2025-01-25/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/elon-musks-call-germany-move-nazi-guilt-dangerous-holocaust-memorial-c-rcna189316) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/26/musk-germany-afd-party-past-guilt-holocaust))
