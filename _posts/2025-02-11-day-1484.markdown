1/ **A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s plan to cut $4 billion in medical research funding**, following lawsuits from 22 states and major universities that argued the cuts would disrupt research on cancer, Alzheimer’s, and other diseases. The cuts would have capped indirect cost reimbursements at 15%, limiting funds for lab maintenance, utilities, and administrative support. Judge Angel Kelley issued a temporary restraining order and scheduled a hearing for Feb. 21. A separate lawsuit from universities seeks a nationwide block, while the Trump administration has defended the policy as a measure to reduce waste. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/10/lawsuit-halts-nih-research-overhead-funding-cut/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/nih-trump-lawsuit-medical-research.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/judge-blocks-trump-cuts-health-research-grants-00203447) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/trump-administration-sued-22-states-funding-cuts-research-projects-rcna191529) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-reignites-legal-fight-freezing-billions-federal-funding/story?id=118695690) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5138712-nih-research-funding-pause-trump/))

2/ **A federal judge ordered the CDC and FDA to restore public health websites taken down after Trump’s executive order restricting federal recognition of gender identities**. The sites, which included data on HIV, youth health risks, and fertility treatments, were removed to comply with the order, prompting a lawsuit by Doctors for America. Judge John Bates ruled that the removal likely violated federal law and harmed doctors’ ability to treat patients. The Justice Department argued that the data was still accessible elsewhere, but Bates rejected this, citing potential public health risks.

3/ **Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency claimed it eliminated over $900 million in Education Department funding, and "terminated" 89 contracts and 29 diversity-related grants**. The cuts, affecting the Institute of Education Sciences, threaten studies on student absenteeism and student behavioral challenges following the pandemic. Sen. Patty Murray called it “a wrecking ball to high-quality research.” Meanwhile, a federal judge delayed ruling on a lawsuit challenging Musk’s team’s access to sensitive student data, raising concerns over privacy and oversight. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/musk-doge-education-data.html))

4/ **The Trump administration fired four FEMA officials, including the agency’s chief financial officer, after Elon Musk falsely claimed that FEMA misused disaster relief funds to house migrants in luxury hotels**. Homeland Security officials accused the employees of circumventing leadership to approve the payments, though the funds had been properly allocated under a program created by Congress in 2023. FEMA’s acting director suspended the payments hours after Musk’s social media post, despite New York City officials clarifying that the funds were not from disaster relief and had not been spent on luxury accommodations. “FEMA should be terminated,” Trump wrote on his personal social media site, arguing that disaster response should be handled by individual states for “big savings” and greater efficiency. City officials said they have not been notified of any funding cuts and will discuss the matter with federal officials. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/nyregion/fema-fired-nyc-migrant-hotels.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/fema-migrant-hotels-new-york-musk-immigration-3d250d9f64b40858c0f0eda9989bea6d) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fema-officials-fired-after-musk-claims-paid-house/story?id=118692963) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-11/trump-calls-for-abolishing-fema-expanding-battle-against-feds) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fema-official-ignores-judge-order-freeze-grant-funding-rcna191674))

5/ **Trump warned that "all hell is going to break out" if Hamas doesn’t release all remaining hostages by Saturday at noon**, urging Israel to cancel its ceasefire if the deadline is not met. Hamas said it would indefinitely postpone the next hostage release, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement by delaying "the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza, targeting them with shelling and gunfire across various parts of the region, and not allowing the entry of relief materials in all agreed forms.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also echoed Trump's comments, saying "the ceasefire will end" and military operations in Gaza would resume if hostages are not freed as scheduled. Meanwhile, Trump reaffirmed his plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza, permanently relocate Palestinians, and redevelop the territory, despite international backlash. And, during a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah, Trump suggested withholding U.S. aid from Jordan and Egypt if they refuse to accept displaced Palestinians.

6/ **Pope Francis condemned Trump’s mass deportation policies, warning they violate human dignity and “will end badly.”** In a letter to U.S. bishops, Francis criticized efforts to equate illegal immigration with criminality and rejected JD Vance’s invocation of "ordo amoris" (translated as “order of love” or “order of charity”) as a defense of the crackdown. Francis said "Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups," but rather it "builds a fraternity open to all, without exception." Meanwhile, Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, dismissed the criticism, urging the pope to “stick to the Catholic Church.” The Vatican has also denounced Trump’s cuts to foreign aid, warning they could have devastating consequences for global humanitarian efforts. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/pope-trump-migration-09a89091f8e7dc3270099f0947d04e90) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-francis-trump-tom-homan-immigration-deportations/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/world/europe/pope-trump-immigration-deportations.html) / [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/pope-francis-trump-mass-deportations-immigration) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/g-s1-48194/pope-rebukes-trump-over-migrant-deportations-and-refutes-vp-vances-theology) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/11/trump-pope-mass-deportation/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/pope-francis-trump-vance-mass-deportations-immigration))

7/ **The Senate voted 52-46 along party lines to advance Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination as Director of National Intelligence**, clearing the way for a final confirmation vote. Gabbard has faced bipartisan scrutiny over her past comments on Edward Snowden, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Democrats opposed her confirmation, with Senator Mark Warner calling her “unfit” for the role. The final vote is expected by Wednesday. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/10/tulsi-gabbard-cloture-senate-dni-confirmation) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-senate-test-vote.html))

8/ **Trump declined to endorse JD Vance as his Republican "successor,"** calling him “very capable” but saying, “It’s too early” to make a decision. Meanwhile at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump "joked" about having a “25-year period” to choose statues for a national garden, then questioned whether he could serve a third term, despite the Constitution’s two-term limit. While advisers dismiss the remarks as trolling, some Republicans have started pushing for a constitutional amendment to allow a third term. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Rep. Andy Ogles have publicly supported the idea, with Ogles introducing a resolution to amend the 22nd Amendment. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-third-term.html) / [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-declines-endorse-jd-vance-2028-successor-2029106))

### ✏️ Notables.

 1. **A federal appeals court dismissed charges against two Trump aides accused of helping him hide classified documents at Mar-a-Lago**, formally ending the prosecution initiated by special counsel Jack Smith. The Justice Department requested the case be dropped, citing a shift in leadership and longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president. The two aides, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, had been charged with obstruction of justice but pleaded not guilty. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/classified-documents-case-justice-department-016141) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-documents-case-walt-nauta-carlos-de-oliveira-case-dismissed/) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5293113/trump-document-case-nauta-de-oliveira))

 2. **Trump removed the director of the Office of Government Ethics**, the agency responsible for overseeing executive branch ethics rules. The dismissal of David Huitema follows the removal of inspectors general and prosecutors tied to Jan. 6 cases. Huitema, appointed by Biden and confirmed in 2024, had been expected to serve a five-year term. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/trump-removes-government-ethics-office-director-00203418) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-office-of-government-ethics-director/) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/10/trump-removes-director-of-government-ethics-office.html))

 3. **Elon Musk will submit a financial disclosure report to the White House, but it will not be made public**. Musk, serving as an unpaid “special government employee,” is not required to disclose his finances under federal law, despite extensive business ties to the government. His companies hold billions in federal contracts and face multiple regulatory investigations, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. While ethics waivers are required for officials with conflicts, the White House has not confirmed whether Musk has received one. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/elon-musk-finances.html))

 4. **The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee accused Kash Patel, Trump’s FBI director nominee, of secretly orchestrating the firing of career officials before his confirmation**. In a letter to the Justice Department’s inspector general, Durbin cited “highly credible” sources suggesting Patel coordinated the dismissals through DOJ officials, contradicting his Senate testimony. Durbin warned that Patel “may have perjured himself” and urged Republicans to reconsider his nomination. The allegations follow mass firings across the DOJ and FBI, including prosecutors tied to Trump-related cases. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/kash-patel-fbi-durbin.html))

 5. **Steve Bannon pleaded guilty to defrauding donors in the "We Build the Wall" fundraising scheme that raised over $15 million**. He will avoid jail time under the plea agreement, but instead receive a three-year conditional discharge and be barred him from running charities or fundraising in New York. Trump had previously pardoned Bannon in a federal case over the same scheme, but state charges are beyond presidential pardon power. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-trump-advisor-bannon-plead-guilty-border-wall-fraud-case-avoid-jail-2025-02-10/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/nyregion/steve-bannon-guilty-plea.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/steve-bannon-pleads-guilty-new-york-build-wall-case-rcna191672) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/steve-bannon-guilty-plea-we-build-the-wall-donor-fraud-new-york/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/steve-bannon-guilty-plea-jailtime-00203559))

 6. **Trump named Richard Grenell interim executive director of the Kennedy Center after appointing himself chairman**. Trump removed 18 Biden-era board members and vowed to end “anti-American propaganda” and drag performances at the center, which is home to the National Symphony Orchestra and Washington National Opera. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/trump-ric-grenell-kennedy-center-00203484) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/arts/music/trump-kennedy-center-board-removed.html))

 7. **The Justice Department directed federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams**, citing concerns about the timing of his trial during an election year and his role in Trump’s immigration policies. Adams had been indicted on bribery and fraud charges related to accepting illegal foreign campaign contributions and luxury travel perks. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/10/nyregion/eric-adams-charges) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/10/new-york-mayor-eric-adams-charges-drop-justice/))

 8. **Trump said the U.S. should receive $500 billion worth of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals as compensation for military and financial aid**, claiming Kyiv has “essentially agreed.” Trump argued “We can’t continue to pay this money” without something in return. ([Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-demands-500b-in-rare-earths-from-ukraine-for-support/))

 9. **The U.S. hit a record low in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking 28th globally**. The drop follows Trump’s conviction and re-election. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/us-record-low-international-corruption-index))

10. **The FBI found 2,400 new JFK assassination records after a Trump-ordered search**. The files, uncovered due to improved record-keeping, will be sent for declassification. Trump pledged to release all assassination records, reviving conspiracy theories. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/10/trump-jfk-assassination-records) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/politics/jfk-assassination-files/index.html))
