1/ **The House passed a Republican spending bill to fund the government through September and avoid a shutdown**. It passed 217-213. The measure keeps spending mostly flat, but increases military funding by $6 billion while cutting $13 billion from nondefense programs, including a $1 billion reduction to Washington, D.C.’s budget. House Republicans largely supported the bill after pressure from Trump and JD Vance, arguing it gives the administration flexibility to reshape federal spending through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Speaker Mike Johnson compared passage of the funding bill to "the Super Bowl,” saying: “This is the moment we’ve all been waiting for our entire careers and finally, the stars have aligned.” In the Senate, Democrats are divided and face a Friday deadline on whether to oppose the bill and risk a shutdown or allow Trump broad control over federal funds. Senate Democrats “need to hold strong on this,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said. “This is not a game. This is extremely serious,” adding that the money provided in the bill is “an unfettered slush fund” for Trump. Republicans will need at least eight Senate Democrats to vote for the bill.

2/ **Trump imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports**, claiming they would protect American industry, but triggering global backlash. Canada and the EU responded with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, including metals, whiskey, and motorcycles, while China imposed levies on agricultural and energy products. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen dismissed Trump’s trade war, saying, “Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers.” Nevertheless, Trump doubled down, threatening reciprocal tariffs on April 2, but quickly backed off his plans to raise Canadian metal tariffs to 50% after Ontario withdrew an electricity surcharge. Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc criticized the White House’s actions, saying, “The U.S. administration is once again inserting disruption and disorder into an incredibly successful trading partnership.” Trump, however, remained defiant and insisted that “Of course I’m going to respond.” Trump’s administration claims tariffs will boost domestic manufacturing despite economists warning they’ll raise consumer prices, disrupt supply chains, and provoke a trade war. Incoming Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney vowed continued resistance, saying, “My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade.” Meanwhile, China suggested further escalation, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning saying “China will take all necessary measures to defend its legitimate rights and interests.” \[*Editor’s note: Lots of moving pieces regarding Trump’s trade war right now, so apologies if this is wildly out of date whenever you read it.*\] ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/12/business/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-us-tariffs-steel-2517a6a2baf0596cb1a43d3a7d1e7939) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/canada-retaliatory-tariffs-21-billion-us-goods-trump-tariffs-latest-rcna196012) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/12/trump-tariffs-eu-counter-levies) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum-levies-imports-europe-china-uk-japan-rcna195810) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/trumps-25percent-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum-imports-take-effect.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-tariffs-steel-no-exemptions-6ed95f5b) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-12/trump-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum-take-effect-with-no-exemptions) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/politics/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/11/trump-tariffs-canada-steel-aluminum) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5324639/trump-canada-tariffs-aluminum-steel) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/11/us-to-double-tariffs-on-canadian-steel-aluminum-00223565) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/11/trump-steel-tariffs-canada/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-11/trump-says-he-s-doubling-tariffs-on-canadian-steel-aluminum))

3/ **Inflation eased in February, but economists warn that Trump’s escalating trade war could undermine that progress**. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.8% from a year earlier – down from 3% in January – while  core inflation, which excludes food and energy, slowed to 3.1% – its lowest since 2021. New tariffs on steel, aluminum, and Chinese goods are expected to push consumer prices higher in the coming months, potentially reversing recent gains.

4/ **The Education Department laid off over 1,300 employees – nearly half its workforce – as Trump pushes to dismantle the agency**. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the reductions aim to "eliminate bureaucratic bloat" and "turn over the agency’s authority to states." Trump campaigned on closing the department, calling it a hub of “radicals, zealots, and Marxists,” though Congress must approve any formal shutdown. The cuts include the closure of regional offices and the consolidation of federal student aid and civil rights enforcement functions. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/education-department-layoffs-job-cuts-linda-mcmahon-ce9f6a8a63972aede0d8fbdf057ab788) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-education-department-firings.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/education-department-cuts-nearly-half-its-workforce-amid-effort-to-close-the-agency-8742bdd1))

5/ **The Social Security Administration is considering eliminating phone services for claims processing and direct deposit transactions, potentially cutting off millions of elderly and disabled Americans from accessing their benefits**. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency claims – without evidence – that Social Security is plagued by fraud. Officials warn that removing phone services would create unnecessary barriers for those who struggle with technology or lack internet access, making it harder to receive benefits they’ve earned. Social Security employees say DOGE is pushing the change without considering alternatives, even though internal reports have debunked the claims of mass fraud.

6/ **Trump bought an $80,000 Tesla to support Elon Musk, falsely claiming that boycotts against the company were “illegal.”** Tesla stock has tanked 15% as Musk’s deep ties to the Trump administration, mass layoffs, and inflammatory rhetoric – including a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration – has fueled protests and vandalism at dealerships. Despite Musk’s repeated claims of “efficiency,” his involvement in gutting federal agencies has raised concerns about corruption and conflicts of interest, while his businesses struggle. Musk, who admitted it is “very difficult” to run his companies while acting as Trump’s enforcer, has also spread baseless conspiracy theories about liberal donors funding Tesla protests. Meanwhile, Trump, who received massive financial support from Musk during his campaign, dismissed concerns and declared that any attacks on Tesla would be labeled “domestic terrorism.” ([Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/musk-tesla-stock-price-plunge-1235292855/) / [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/626851/tesla-takedown-protests-elon-musk) / [CNBC](https://www.theverge.com/news/626851/tesla-takedown-protests-elon-musk) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/tesla-stock-market-elon-musk.html) / [Business Insider](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/business/tesla-stock-market-elon-musk.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-11/trump-says-he-ll-buy-a-tesla-to-support-musk-after-shares-plunge) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/tesla-stock-musk-trump-evs-sales-b3118cbab69fbfaa3abcceb059ba8c58) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-elon-musk-tesla.html) / [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/elon-musk-says-doge-involvement-is-making-it-harder-to-run-his-businesses/) / [Mother Jones](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/elon-musk-says-doge-involvement-is-making-it-harder-to-run-his-businesses/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-musk-tesla-9a43c57a0591a4c7ed8d3f1b2c7ef8d9))

7/ **A federal judge ruled that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency must comply with public records requests, citing its “unprecedented” power and secrecy**. Judge Christopher Cooper found that DOGE likely falls under the Freedom of Information Act, and ordered the release of internal documents. The Trump administration must submit a report by March 20 estimating the number of relevant documents.
