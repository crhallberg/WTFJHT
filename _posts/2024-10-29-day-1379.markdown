1/ **Kamala Harris will challenge Americans to ‚Äúturn the page‚Äù on Trump in a speech from the Ellipse in Washington** ‚Äì the same spot where Trump directed his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, to ‚Äúfight like hell‚Äù and march on the Capitol. Harris will step onstage around 7:30 p.m. tonight and, according to the prepared remarks, she‚Äôll detail how ‚ÄúTrump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That‚Äôs who he is. But America, I am here tonight to say: That‚Äôs not who we are.‚Äù Harris will frame the election as a choice between two different visions for the country, saying "Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him. People he calls ‚Äì quote ‚Äì¬†'the enemy from within.' This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better." The campaign expects as many as 40,000 people to attend, according to an amended National Park Service permit for the event.

2/ **Trump and his allies insist he's "not a Nazi" and when urged to apologize for the racist comments made at his Madison Square Garden campaign rally, Trump responded that it was an ‚Äúhonor to be involved‚Äù and called it "an absolute lovefest."** Trump later claimed he was unaware of the speakers at his campaign event, saying: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know him; someone put him up there. I don‚Äôt know who he is.‚Äù Nearly a million Puerto Ricans live in swing states. JD Vance, meanwhile, said he doesn't believe the racist joke that Puerto Rico is "floating island of garbage" will stop people voting for the Republican presidential ticket. He added "we have to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America. I'm just ‚Äî I'm so over it."

3/ **Two ballot drop boxes were set on fire**. ‚ÄúAn incendiary device was placed inside the ballot box" in Portland, Oregon, but a "Fire suppressant inside the ballot box protected virtually all ballots." Hours later, a drop box in nearby Vancouver, Washington, was set on fire. Officials said "hundreds" of ballots were affected. Police said a ‚Äúsuspect vehicle‚Äù had been identified from surveillance footage, that the fires were connected, and that they‚Äôre also related to an Oct. 8 incident when an incendiary device was placed at a different drop box in Vancouver. The FBI also said it was investigating both fires ‚Äúto determine who is responsible.‚Äù ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168404/oregon-washington-arizona-ballots-drop-boxes-fires) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/us/politics/ballot-box-fires-oregon-washington.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/ballot-drop-boxes-explainer-2024-portland-vancouver-ff3023c566fcc0282eb8ee84de297bf9) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/28/us/ballot-box-fires-oregon-washington/))

4/ **The Supreme Court declined to let Robert F. Kennedy Jr. withdraw his name from ballots in Michigan and Wisconsin**. Kennedy, who supports Trump, claimed that the two swing states are violating his constitutional rights by leaving him on the ballot against his wishes. When Kennedy suspended his campaign, he said his name would remain on the ballot and he encouraged his supporters to vote for him in most states. Wisconsin and Michigan, however, are two of the seven states expected to determine the outcome of the election, which is why he‚Äôs seeking to have his name dropped from the ballots in states where it could help Trump.

5/ **Steve Bannon was released from prison** after serving four months on contempt of Congress charges for refusing to comply with a subpoena related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. ‚ÄúThe four months in federal prison not only didn‚Äôt break me, it empowered me,‚Äù Bannon said. ‚ÄúI am more energized and more focused than I‚Äôve ever been in my entire life.‚Äù ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/steve-bannon-released-prison/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/steve-bannon-released-prison-serving-contempt-congress-sentence-rcna177692) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/steve-bannon-prison-release-56f2f7a17ae2273a29a0829234f56fae) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/steve-bannon-prison-release.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/29/steve-bannon-released-prison-trump-election))

6/ **The federal judge overseeing the prosecution of a man accused of trying to assassinate Trump denied a request to recuse herself in the case**. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the federal bench in Florida in 2020 by Trump, said Trump‚Äôs repeated praise of her ‚Äî and the ‚Äúspeculation‚Äù that he could promote her if elected president ‚Äî are not enough to warrant her recusal from cases involving Trump. Cannon is separately overseeing the federal classified document and obstruction case against Trump.
