* **The presidential election is TODAY**.

* #### üó≥Ô∏è When polls close in the battleground states:

* **Georgia**: 7 pm (Trump \+0.8) \
  **North Carolina**: 7:30 pm (Trump \+0.9) \
  **Michigan** (most): 8 pm (Harris \+1.0) \
  **Pennsylvania**: 8 pm (Harris \+0.2) \
  **Arizona**: 9 pm (Trump \+2.1) \
  **Michigan**: 9 pm (Harris \+1.0) \
  **Wisconsin**: 9 pm (Harris \+1.0) \
  **Nevada**: 10 pm (Trump \+0.3)

* *All times Eastern. Polling averages from FiveThirtyEight.*

* ***Editor‚Äôs note**: The 2020 election took nearly 90 hours after the final polls closed until Biden was declared president-elect. It probably won‚Äôt take that long this time: Near-complete results from Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina are expected on election night, along with most of Wisconsin's results by Wednesday morning. Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada, meanwhile, will likely be counting ballots through Wednesday*.

1/ **More than 83 million Americans voted early in the first presidential election since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol**. Polls show the presidential race between Harris and Trump to be historically close and likely decided by a handful of voters in the seven battleground states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and North Carolina. Control of the House and Senate is also on the line with 435 House seats and 34 Senate seats up for grabs. Democrats need to flip four seats to win control of the House, while in the Senate the Republicans have a clear path for control. Voters in 10 states will [decide](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/05/politics/abortion-state-ballot-measure-dg/index.html) [whether](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measures-harris-trump-florida-missouri-49c9073cbb6056b66a8a7d0d099795d1) to cement reproductive rights in their state constitutions. In 62 days, Kamala Harris will preside over a joint session of Congress. After counting the 2024 electoral votes, Harris will either declare herself the winner ‚Äì marking the first woman elected president ‚Äì or announce that Trump is returning to the White House as the second president to be elected to two nonconsecutive terms ‚Äì and at 78 years old, the oldest person ever elected president.

2/ **Trump and Harris held competing rallies throughout the final day of campaigning, urging supporters to turn out for what is likely one of the closest presidential elections in modern history**. In Pennsylvania, Harris said ‚ÄúAmerica is ready for a fresh start, where we see our fellow Americans not as an enemy but as a neighbor.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúWe have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of politics that have been driven by fear and division." Trump, in his third presidential campaign, closed by calling the United States an ‚Äúoccupied country,‚Äù threatened tariffs as high as 100% on Mexico, insulted Harris as a ‚Äúlow-IQ person,‚Äù portrayed undocumented immigrants as mentally ill criminals, and called those accused of crimes ‚Äúsavages‚Äù and ‚Äúanimals.‚Äù  Harris said ‚Äúthe measure of a true leader is based not on who you beat down. It is based on who you lift up.‚Äù Neverthless, Trump claimed he was "running against an evil Democrat system" populated by "sick" and "evil people," but ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs too big to be rigged. They‚Äôll try, and they are trying. You know that.‚Äù Trump all but called Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, a bitch, saying: "She‚Äôs an evil, sick, crazy bi- oh no. It starts with a ‚Äòb,‚Äô but I won‚Äôt say it. I want to say it!‚Äù JD Vance described Democratic leaders as "trash," adding that ‚Äúin two days we are going to take out the trash in Washington, D.C. And the trash‚Äôs name is Kamala Harris.‚Äù Elsewhere, Harris told supports ‚ÄúOur campaign has brought together people from all corners of this nation and from all walks of life, united by our love for our country and our faith in a brighter, stronger and more hopeful future that we will build together.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúAnd tonight, we finish as we started, with optimism, with energy, with joy.‚Äù Trump, meanwhile, said: ‚ÄúThis will be our final moment. I think we‚Äôve got it under control \[...\] It‚Äôs ours to lose. Does that make sense to you? It‚Äôs ours to lose \[...\] This has been an incredible journey. It‚Äôs very sad in a way. This is the last one.‚Äù Harris concluded her day, telling her supporters: ‚ÄúOne more day. And momentum is on our side.‚Äù The crowd chanted with Harris when she delivered her signature line: ‚ÄúWe are not going back.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/us/politics/harris-trump-pennsylvania-campaign.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/05/trump-final-days-2024-campaign/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/05/kamala-harris-historic-campaign-finish-anxiety-optimism/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-campaign-doubles-final-hours-election-dash/story?id=115509852) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/donald-trump-jd-vance-transgender-2024-election-rcna178390) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/04/nx-s1-5177397/2024-election-trump-harris) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4971935-trump-michigan-closing-rally/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/05/trump-blends-nostalgia-with-attacks-on-pelosi-and-harris-in-final-campaign-speech-00187368) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/04/trump-harris-end-campaign/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/04/us/harris-trump-election) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-harris-make-final-push-blitz-rallies-battleground-states-rcna178605))
