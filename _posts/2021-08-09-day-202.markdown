1/ **The Pentagon will require all members of the U.S. military to get the COVID vaccine by September 15.** Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the mid-September deadline could be accelerated if the vaccine receives final FDA approval or infection rates continue to rise. “Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key force protection and readiness issue,” Gen. Mark Milley wrote. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-3975940c732352f72e41f6e34a3a2669))

2/ **A Texas judge blocked the arrest of Democratic legislators who fled the state to stop the GOP from imposing new voting restrictions.** State District Judge Brad Urrutia, a Democrat, signed a temporary restraining order late Sunday in a case newly filed by 19 Texas House Democrats against Gov. Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dade Phelan, both Republicans, who have called for arrests to restore a quorum in the House.

3/ **Senate Democrats unveiled a budget resolution that includes $3.5 trillion in spending boosts and tax breaks aimed at strengthening social and environmental programs.** The measure lays the groundwork for separate legislation later this year that over a decade would pour mountains of federal resources into Democrats’ top priorities. Included would be more money for health care, education, family services and environmental programs and tax breaks for families, with much of it paid for with tax increases on the rich and corporations.

4/ **Trump's former acting attorney general testified about Trump’s efforts to subvert the 2020 election**. Jeffrey Rosen had a two-hour meeting with the Justice Department’s office of the inspector general and provided closed-door testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Saturday.

5/ **A top aide to NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned in the wake of the state attorney general’s report on Cuomo's sexual harassment.** The departure of Melissa DeRosa, who held the title of secretary to the governor, is considered a huge blow to Cuomo. The investigation into allegations of harassment by the New York governor also detailed DeRosa’s role in an effort to discredit one of Cuomo's accusers.
