1/ **Trump confirmed that he plans to declare a national emergency "on day 1" to use the military to carry out "the largest deportation program in American history."** Trump responded ‚ÄúTRUE!!!‚Äù at 4:08 am to a post on his personal social media network that his incoming administration is ‚Äúprepared to declare a national emergency and will use military assets to reverse the Biden invasion through a mass deportation program.‚Äù There are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. ‚Äì¬†about 3% of the total U.S. population. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/18/immigration-100-days-trump-executive-action-00189286) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/us/politics/trump-military-mass-deportation.html) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-confirms-plan-declare-national-emergency-military-mass/story?id=115963448) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-18/trump-confirms-he-plans-to-use-military-for-mass-deportations) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/18/trump-administration-transition/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/18/trump-mass-deportations-military-national-emergency))

* **ACLU sues ICE for transparency on Trump‚Äôs mass deportation plans and private deportation flights**. The ACLU filed a lawsuit against ICE, accusing the agency of withholding information about its deportation operations, including contracts with private airlines and conditions on deportation flights. The lawsuit comes as Trump prepares to implement mass deportations, a campaign promise with few disclosed details. Advocates seek to uncover ICE‚Äôs practices, citing concerns over human rights abuses and misuse of taxpayer dollars. ICE has faced criticism for opaque operations and mistreatment of detainees, including shackling families and inadequate oversight of private contractors. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2024/11/18/trump-mass-deportation-aclu-lawsuit/))

2/ **The Trump transition team is compiling a list of current and former U.S. military officers involved in the withdrawal from Afghanistan for possible court-martial**. A 2022 independent review by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction blamed both the Trump and Biden administrations for the chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Nevertheless, the Trump team reportedly wants to create a commission to investigate the withdrawal, determine who was directly involved in the decision-making for the military and whether the military leaders could be charged with treason for following Biden‚Äôs order to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Trump has called the withdrawal a ‚Äúhumiliation‚Äù and ‚Äúthe most embarrassing day in the history of our country.‚Äù ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-transition-team-compiling-list-current-former-us-military-office-rcna180489))

3/ **House Speaker Mike Johnson said he‚Äôd "strongly request" that the House Ethics Committee not release its report into allegations of sex trafficking, corruption, and drug use by Matt Gaetz**,¬†Trump‚Äôs nominee for attorney general. "That is not the way we do things in the House," Johnson said. "I think that would be a terrible precedent to set." Gaetz resigned from Congress days before a House panel was set to vote on releasing a report on the allegations against Gaetz. His resignation ended the Ethics panel‚Äôs jurisdiction over him. The House Ethics Committee, meanwhile, will meet Wednesday to discuss and potentially vote to release the report anyway. Both Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee want the report released for Senate consideration on whether to confirm Gaetz for attorney general. House Ethics Chair Michael Guest said the Ethics Committee will make its own decision about releasing the report, regardless of Johnson‚Äôs opinion. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/politics/johnson-ethics-report-gaetz/index.html) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/matt-gaetz-ethics-committee-report-mike-johnson/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/18/congress/guest-speaks-to-johnson-on-gaetz-report-00190214) / [CNBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-ethics-committee-meet-wednesday-discuss-matt-gaetz-report-rcna180623) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/18/house-ethics-panel-matt-gaetz-00190107) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/18/ethics-committee-matt-gaetz-attorney-general))

* **A woman who attended a 2017 party with Matt Gaetz told the House Ethics Committee she witnessed him having sex with a minor**. The account corroborates the testimony of the then-minor, who told the committee that she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 years old. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/witness-told-house-ethics-she-saw-gaetz-having-sex-with-minor-2017/))

4/ **Trump‚Äôs pick for secretary of defense paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault as part of a nondisclosure agreement**. Pete Hegseth denied any wrongdoing, and maintains that he is innocent and the sexual encounter was consensual. Neverthless, Hegseth agreed to pay an undisclosed amount to the woman as part of a confidentiality settlement to deter his accuser from going forward with a lawsuit. Hegseth believed a lawsuit could have gotten him fired from Fox News, where he was then a host. The alleged sexual assault took place after midnight on Oct. 8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa. The woman filed a complaint with the Monterey Police Department four days later alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by Hegseth. The city of Monterey said investigators found the woman had "contusions" on her right thigh. No charges were filed. Hegseth [reportedly](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/pete-hegseth-misconduct-allegation-meeting) was not vetted before Trump tapped him to be Defense Secretary. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/16/pete-hegseth-sexual-assault-accuser-paid/) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pete-hegseth-sexual-assault-allegation-payment/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/17/trump-pentagon-pick-sex-assault-allegation-00190046))

* **Trump's Pentagon pick flagged over extremist-linked tattoo and dismissal of military extremism concerns**. Pete Hegseth was flagged in 2021 as a potential "insider threat" due to a tattoo associated with white supremacist groups. Hegseth has dismissed concerns about extremism in the military as fabricated and has criticized efforts to remove extremists from the ranks. His controversial views and past actions, including defending convicted war criminals and minimizing the role of veterans in the January 6 Capitol attack, raise alarm about his fitness to lead the Pentagon. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-defense-department-pentagon-hegseth-fox-news-8cd9f065e54a7cbbaceeec8bae9261a6))

5/ **Trump‚Äôs transition team is skipping the traditional FBI background checks to vet some Cabinet nominees**. Instead, Trump is using private companies, claiming the traditional process can be slow, which sometimes reveals embarrassing and politically damaging information. The protocol was established after World War II to make sure nominees don‚Äôt have unknown foreign ties or other national security concerns. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/politics/security-clearances-fbi-gabbard-gaetz/index.html))

* **üí≠ Why does this matter?** Bypassing FBI vetting for high-level government appointments sets a concerning precedent for national security. FBI background checks are designed to identify potential risks, including undisclosed foreign ties or ethical breaches, ensuring that appointees are fit for sensitive roles. Circumventing these safeguards exposes critical government operations to vulnerabilities, undermining public trust in the integrity of the administration. Additionally, such actions could embolden future administrations to disregard institutional checks and balances, weakening the framework of accountability essential for democratic governance.

6/ **House Speaker Mike Johnson said "there may be a function" to facilitate the use of recess appointments so Trump can appoint his Cabinet nominees outside of the Senate confirmation process**. Johnson noted that there‚Äôs "a very partisan atmosphere" in Washington, which could hinder the process of Senate confirmations. "But if this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country, to the American people.‚Äù A recess appointment is when a president unilaterally bypasses the Senate to confirm Cabinet nominees when both the House and Senate are not in session for at least 10 days. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll evaluate all that at the appropriate time, and we‚Äôll make the appropriate decision," Johnson added. "There may be a function for that. We‚Äôll have to see how it plays out.‚Äù ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mike-johnson-leaves-door-open-recess-appointments-trump-cabinet-rcna180540) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/17/johnson-trump-recess-appointment-senate-confirmation))

* **üí≠ Why does this matter?** If Trump proceeds with this constitutional maneuver, it would mark a significant escalation in the expansion of presidential power. The Senate‚Äôs confirmation authority is a cornerstone of the system of checks and balances designed to limit executive overreach. Undermining this process could set a precedent for future presidents to bypass legislative oversight, weakening a critical safeguard against authoritarian tendencies. It reflects broader challenges to institutional norms under Trump's leadership.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Notables.

1. **A group of armed, masked individuals waving flags with swastikas on them marched through the streets of Columbus, Ohio**. Police said the individuals were "armed with firearms." The White House, city, state, and Jewish community leaders in Ohio condemned the group. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/18/neo-nazi-march-columbus-ohio/) / [WBNS 10TV](https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/neo-nazi-march-short-north-columbus/530-91e879b2-f2ed-475c-9455-da5e3cd4f5ed) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/white-house-condemns-sickening-nazi-march-ohio/story?id=115968182) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ohio-march-nazi-flags-racist-slogans-columbus-rcna180577))

2. **Trump‚Äôs allies were told to stop using the word ‚Äúcamps‚Äù during the current presidential transition because "apparently some people think it makes us look like Nazis.‚Äù** Trump‚Äôs team is steering clear of describing proposed migrant detention centers as ‚Äúcamps‚Äù due to negative historical connotations, despite prior use of the term by his advisers like Stephen Miller. The incoming administration plans a significant expansion of detention facilities, potentially involving military construction, to support mass deportations. Critics draw parallels to fascist regimes, while Trump‚Äôs allies seek to reframe the narrative by emphasizing "targeted arrests" and downplaying the scale of operations. ([Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-allies-migrants-camps-miller-homan-1235168998/))

3. **Haitians flee Springfield, Ohio, after Trump win fuels deportation fears and economic uncertainty**. After Trump's re-election and his promise to end Temporary Protected Status  for Haitian immigrants, many are leaving out of fear of deportation. The exodus threatens local businesses and the economy, as the Haitian community has revitalized neighborhoods and filled essential jobs. False rumors, heightened anti-immigrant rhetoric, and neo-Nazi activity have exacerbated tensions, leading many to seek safer locations. Experts note that immediate deportations are unlikely due to legal processes, but the economic and social impacts on Springfield are already being felt. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/17/haitian-immigrants-springfield-ohio-trump-election))

4. **Trump team targets Biden's EV tax credit, potentially reshaping U.S. electric vehicle market**. Trump‚Äôs transition team, led by oil executive Harold Hamm, plans to eliminate the $7,500 EV tax credit as part of broader tax reforms, arguing it reduces government costs and helps extend expiring Trump-era tax cuts. Tesla supports the move, as Elon Musk believes it will harm competitors more than his company. Critics, including automakers and unions, warn this could cripple the U.S. EV industry, harm efforts to compete with China's heavily subsidized EV market, and jeopardize thousands of auto jobs tied to Biden‚Äôs pro-EV policies. ([Reuters](https://www.memeorandum.com/))

5. **Trump team prioritizes easing federal restrictions on self-driving vehicles to boost Tesla and autonomous tech rollout**. Trump‚Äôs transition team is pursuing a federal framework for self-driving cars, a move that could accelerate autonomous vehicle adoption and directly benefit Tesla. Elon Musk has made autonomous technology a cornerstone of his business. Current regulations limit manufacturers to deploying 2,500 self-driving cars annually, hindering mass production of vehicles without human controls. The proposed changes aim to eliminate regulatory hurdles, though safety concerns and past legislative failures suggest challenges ahead. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars))

6. **Biden authorized Ukraine to use American long-range weapon for strikes inside Russia**. The missiles, known as the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, can travel about 190 miles. Ukraine is authorized to use the weapons to target in and around Kursk ‚Äî the same region where some 10,000 North Korean troops were deployed. The policy shift, influenced by North Korea's involvement and escalating Russian aggression, aims to bolster Ukraine's defenses two months before Trump takes office.

*News analysis and opinions on today‚Äôs key headlines ‚Äì why they matter and what‚Äôs at stake.*

1. **Democrats face messaging challenges as Trump leverages "ambient information" to shape public opinion**. The Democrats‚Äô reliance on detailed policy and micro-targeting was outpaced by Trump‚Äôs strategy of spreading broad, resonant narratives across national platforms. By tapping into ‚Äúambient information‚Äù ‚Äî ideas and beliefs that circulate widely regardless of truth ‚Äî Trump shaped public perceptions in ways Democrats struggled to counter. Harris‚Äôs campaign, while policy-focused and community-oriented, failed to break through a media environment dominated by Trump‚Äôs broad and sometimes misleading messaging, highlighting the power of vibes over data in modern elections. ([New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/republican-victory-and-the-ambience-of-information))

2. **Democrats struggle with lack of partisan social media platforms as online discourse shifts right**. Right-wing platforms like Truth Social, Gab, and Parler have grown in influence, while X under Elon Musk has amplified Trump‚Äôs agenda, leaving Democrats with fewer social media avenues for political discourse. Major platforms like Facebook and Instagram have de-emphasized politics, creating an online imbalance that favors conservative messaging. Efforts to create left-leaning spaces, like Bluesky, remain in their infancy, putting Democrats at a disadvantage in shaping public opinion online. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/technology/election-right-wing-social-media.html))

3. **Social media influencers redefine news, engaging 20% of Americans, led by 37% of under-30s**. Pew Research Center‚Äôs report explores the growing influence of social media news influencers, revealing that 1 in 5 Americans‚Äî37% among young adults‚Äîrely on them for current events. These influencers operate primarily on platforms like X and Instagram, with 77% unaffiliated with traditional media. Content trends lean toward political discourse, with slightly more right-leaning voices (27%) than left (21%). The study underscores their critical role in reshaping media consumption, especially among digitally native audiences. ([Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/11/18/americas-news-influencers/))

4. **Democrats‚Äô inflation gamble backfires as economic missteps fuel political defeat**. Biden's aggressive $1.9 trillion stimulus, designed to avoid past recovery mistakes, contributed to post-pandemic inflation, undermining Democrats‚Äô political standing. Rising costs of living outpaced voter appreciation for job growth and economic recovery efforts, allowing Trump to exploit economic dissatisfaction. Internal debates over spending and messaging, combined with external factors like global supply chain disruptions, further hindered Democrats‚Äô ability to address inflation effectively, sealing their electoral losses. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/inflation-joe-biden-mistakes-aa77b9cf))

5. **Trump‚Äôs campaign against the media mirrors autocratic strategies, reshaping U.S. press freedoms**. Trump has used tactics like regulatory threats and leadership pressure to influence media outlets, including CNN and The Washington Post, making them more cautious in their coverage. These actions, combined with shifts in social media policies, have reduced media independence and raised concerns about press freedom and accountability. ([Columbia Journalism Review](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/anticipatory-obedience-bassin-potter-scheppele-orban-trump-hungary-media-punish.php))

6. **Trump‚Äôs proposed appointments signal deliberate attempts to dismantle core democratic institutions**. Timothy Snyder argues that Trump‚Äôs proposed Cabinet appointments are strategically chosen to destabilize essential pillars of American democracy, including health, law, administration, defense, and intelligence. Figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Matt Gaetz, Elon Musk, and Tulsi Gabbard represent a coordinated effort to undermine the government by eroding public trust, compromising national security, and dismantling critical systems. Snyder warns that this "decapitation strike" could irreparably damage the United States, urging bipartisan resistance to prevent national collapse.
