1/ **Obama privately told allies that Biden needs to seriously reconsider his candidacy** because his path to victory has been greatly diminished since the debate. Obama said he‚Äôs concerned that the polls and donors are moving away from Biden, while Trump‚Äôs electoral path is expanding. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/obama-says-biden-must-consider-viability/))

2/ **Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and Nancy Pelosi each told Biden separately that he should reconsider his reelection bid** ‚Äì or else risk losing and dragging the rest of the Democrats down with him. Schumer was reportedly "blunt" and ‚Äúpretty harsh,‚Äù saying it would be better for the country and the Democratic Party if he ended his reelection campaign. Jeffries offered a similar message, saying Biden could put Democratic chances in the House at risk if he remained in the race. Pelosi, meanwhile, told Biden the polling data shows he can‚Äôt defeat Trump and that he‚Äôll destroy Democrats‚Äô chances of winning the House in November if he continues his campaign. Biden said he‚Äôd seen polling that showed otherwise. Much of the recent public polling shows that Biden narrowly trails Trump nationally, though much of the data remains within the margin of error, suggesting the race is a toss-up. When asked about the conversations, the White House responded: "President Biden is the nominee of the party. He plans to win, and looks forward to working with congressional Democrats to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families."

3/ **Biden is reportedly "more receptive" and "willing to listen" to arguments about why he should step aside** after a number of Democrats have pressed him to reconsider his presidential bid. One Democratic adviser [said](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/trump-biden-analysis-2024/index.html) Biden has gone from saying ‚ÄúKamala can‚Äôt win,‚Äù to asking ‚ÄúDo you think Kamala can win?‚Äù Although Biden hasn‚Äôt given any indication that he‚Äôs changing his mind about staying in the race, several top Democrats privately said they now believe Biden will drop out ‚Äì possibly as soon as this weekend. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre close to the end,‚Äù one person close to Biden said. Another added that ‚Äúreality is setting in‚Äù and it [wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/biden-election-drop-out.html) if  Biden made an announcement and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement. [Meanwhile](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/rnc-trump-republican-convention-live-updates-rcna161245), one person close to Biden blamed senior Democratic leaders for "[giving] us Donald Trump," saying "In 2015, Obama, Pelosi, Schumer pushed Biden aside in favor of Hillary; they were wrong then, and they are wrong now. How did all this work out for everyone in 2016? Perhaps we should learn a few lessons from 2016; one of them is polls are BS, just ask Sec. Clinton. And two, maybe, just maybe, Joe Biden is more in touch with actual Americans than Obama-Pelosi-Schumer?" ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/politics/dnc-biden-nomination.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-world-braces-possibility-president-steps-rcna162494) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/biden-democratic-advisers-campaign/index.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/18/president-biden-drop-out-election-democrats))

4/ **Biden tested positive for Covid-19** and is isolating at his Rehoboth Beach home in Delaware. Biden was tested after he experienced upper respiratory symptoms and "general malaise." He received a dose of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, doesn't have a fever, and his symptoms remain mild. The Biden campaign, meanwhile, attempted to fundraise off the 81-year-old testing positive Covid-19, tweeting: "I'm sick." Two minutes later, it followed up with "of Elon Musk and his rich buddies trying to buy this election. And if you agree, pitch in here," with a link to donate.
