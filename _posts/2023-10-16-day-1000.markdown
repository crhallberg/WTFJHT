1/ **A federal judge imposed a narrow gag order on Trump**, restricting him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, and court staff involved in his election subversion case. “This is not about whether I like the language Mr. Trump uses,” Judge Tanya Chutkan said. “This is about language that presents a danger to the administration of justice [...] His presidential candidacy does not give him carte blanche to vilify public servants who are simply doing their jobs.” Chutkan didn't specify how she would enforce the gag order, but said she would address any consequences if and when Trump violated it. Before the order was even issued, Trump’s lawyer said they would appeal the ruling. Prosecutors had argued that a gag order was necessary to protect the integrity of judicial proceedings. Trump faces four felony charges in connection with what prosecutors allege was a "criminal scheme" to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election by enlisting a slate of so-called "fake electors," using the Justice Department to conduct "sham election crime investigations," trying to enlist Pence to "alter the election results," and promoting false claims of a stolen election as the Jan. 6 riot raged. The gag order doesn't extend to Trump’s three other pending criminal trials for election obstruction in Georgia,  classified documents in Florida, or hush money payments during the 2016 campaign in New York.

2/ **The Biden administration reached a settlement with the more than 4,000 migrants who were separated from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border by the Trump administration**. Under the proposed agreement, the federal government would be prohibited from using a “zero tolerance” prosecution policy to separated migrant families crossing the border for eight years. The settlement would also provide temporary benefits to separated families such as housing aid, work permits, health care, and allow them to apply for asylum again. In total, more than 4,000 children were separated from their families, including 290 U.S. citizen children, under the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy. An estimated 1,000 children still remain separated from their parents.

3/ **Biden warned Israel that occupying Gaza would be a "big mistake,"** but added that “taking out the extremists is a necessary requirement.” Israel’s defense minister told the U.S. to brace for a “long war” against Hamas, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied reporting that the Rafah border crossing with Egypt would reopen as temporary humanitarian corridor. More than a million people – about half of Gaza's total population – have been displaced since the Israeli military declared a “complete siege” to the enclave in retaliation for the Oct. 7 terror attack by Hamas. The World Health Organization and United Nations, meanwhile, have warned that Gaza faces an “imminent” public health crisis as the enclave is running out of food and water. Hospitals are expected run out of fuel within 24 hours.

4/ **Jim Jordan will force a House vote on Tuesday in his bid for speaker after winning the support of several key Republican skeptics**. Reps. Mike Rogers and Ann Wagner were "hard no" on Jordan last week, but have now publicly endorsed the Ohioan, as have Ken Calvert and Vern Buchanan. Jordan needs to win at least 217 votes to become speaker in a chamber that is narrowly divided between 221 Republicans and 212 Democrats. He still faces an uphill climb to be elected speaker and can only lose four Republicans if every member votes. The House has been without a permanent speaker for nearly two weeks after eight Republicans sided with Democrats in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy.
