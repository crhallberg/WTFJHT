1/ **Kamala Harris said she supports ending the Senate filibuster to restore Roe v. Wade to protect abortion rights nationally**. ‚ÄúI think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúAnd get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.‚Äù In 2022, Harris said that Congress needed to codify Roe into law and, ‚Äúif the filibuster gets in the way, the Senate needs to make an exception to get it done.‚Äù Joe Manchin, [meanwhile](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/24/politics/joe-manchin-not-endorse-harris-filibuster/index.html), will not endorse Harris after she reiterated her support for bypassing the filibuster to protect abortion rights. He added: "Shame on her."

* **More women are charged with pregnancy-related crimes since Roe‚Äôs end, study finds**. "In the year after the U.S. Supreme Court ended the nationwide right to abortion in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization ruling, at least 210 women across the country were charged with crimes related to their pregnancies, according to the report released by Pregnancy Justice, an advocacy organization. That‚Äôs the highest number the group has identified over any 12-month period in research projects that have looked back as far as 1973."

2/ **More than 400 economists and former White House policy advisors endorsed Kamala Harris and her economic plan**. ‚ÄúThe choice in this election is clear,‚Äù the letter read. ‚ÄúIt is a choice between inequity, economic injustice, and uncertainty with Donald Trump or prosperity, opportunity, and stability with Kamala Harris.‚Äù Harris‚Äôs economic policies largely focus on addressing the high cost of lowering housing, increasing small business expenses, expanding the child tax credit, and lifting the corporate tax rate to 28%. Trump, meanwhile, has pledged to cut taxes and impose high tariffs on imports, which risks reigniting inflation.

3/ **A Haitian nonprofit group filed criminal charges against Trump and JD Vance** for continuously repeating the baseless, false online conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. The complaint filed by Haitian Bridge Alliance alleges that Trump and Vance had a ‚Äúdirect impact‚Äù on the 33 bomb threats that disrupted city services and temporarily shut down the schools. The charges include disrupting public service, making false alarms, committing telecommunications harassment, committing aggravated menacing, and violating the prohibition against complicity.

4/ **Trump‚Äôs campaign continued to be hacked until at least mid-September ‚Äì¬†and may be ongoing**. An account using the alias ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù revealed internal Trump campaign dossiers and documents dated as recently as Sept. 15, and suggested it was the same ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù who sent stolen Trump campaign records to the media in August and July. U.S. intelligence officials concluded that Iran was behind the previous hack of Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign and the attempted attack on the Biden-Harris campaign. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung, meanwhile, said the hack indicates that Iran ‚Äúis terrified of the strength and resolve of President Donald J. Trump.‚Äù ([Popular Information](https://popular.info/p/trump-campaign-hack) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/09/23/2024/trump-hack-continued-into-last-week) / [Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-campaign-was-hacked-again-in-the-last-10-days))

5/ **In his final speech as president before the United Nations General Assembly, Biden warned that the world is facing an ‚Äúinflection point‚Äù** and "the choices we make today will determine our future. For the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come." While reflecting on his five decades of public service, he advise his fellow leaders that "some things are more important than staying in power." He added: ‚ÄúOur task, our test, is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than those pulling us apart, that the principles of partnership that we come here each year to uphold can withstand the challenges, that the center holds once again.‚Äù Biden also urged Israel and Hezbollah to step away from all-out war, while also stressing the importance of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
