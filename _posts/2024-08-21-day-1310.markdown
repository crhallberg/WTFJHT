1/ **Barack and Michelle Obama delivered back-to-back speeches on the second night of the Democratic National Convention, casting Trump as selfish and dangerous while painting Kamala Harris as the heir to their movement**. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need four more years of bluster and chaos. We‚Äôve seen that movie ‚Äî and we all know that the sequel‚Äôs usually worse,‚Äù Barack Obama said, torching Trump for his fixation with ‚Äúchildish nicknames,‚Äù his ‚Äúcrazy conspiracy theories,‚Äù and ‚Äúthis weird obsession with crowd sizes‚Äù ‚Äì gesturing with his hands in a way to indicate something small with regard to masculine proportions. ‚ÄúAmerica is ready for a new chapter," Barack said. "America‚Äôs ready for a better story. We are ready for a President Kamala Harris.‚Äù In her remarks, Michelle Obama delivered a similar message, saying: ‚ÄúAmerica, hope is making a comeback,‚Äù adding that Harris ‚Äúunderstands that most of us will never be afforded the grace of failing forward. We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth." She rebuked Trump for how ‚Äúhis limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who happened to be Black.‚Äù She paused momentarily before adding: ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs going to tell him that the job he‚Äôs currently seeking might just be one of those ‚ÄòBlack jobs?‚Äô‚Äù Michelle, however, cautioned that optimism shouldn‚Äôt lead to complacency, saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to us to remember what Kamala‚Äôs mother told her: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt just sit around and complain. Do something,‚Äô‚Äù as the convention crowd chanted: ‚ÄúDo something! Do something!‚Äù The third night of the DNC will be [headlined](https://apnews.com/article/democratic-national-convention-walz-clinton-harris-4f299bd2684c0284dd100f7f0731172f) by Tim Walz and Bill Clinton.

2/ **The Georgia State Election Board approved a new rule requiring a ‚Äúreasonable inquiry‚Äù before certifying state elections**. The rule requires county election officials to generate lists of ‚Äúthe total number of ballots cast‚Äù and ‚Äúthe total number of persons who voted,‚Äù categorize them by voting method, and then examine them by hand for duplicates. Voting rights advocates warn that empowering county election officials, most of who are partisan appointees, to delay certification of November's presidential election results, could introduce skepticism about the legitimacy of the election. The vote was 3 to 2 by the five-member board. In early August, during a rally, Trump praised by name the three board members who are aligned with him, calling them ‚Äúpit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory‚Äù and saying they were ‚Äúdoing a great job.‚Äù ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-elections-certification-rule-26551bd40f5a246035bc3d4c06e4d9b9) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/georgia-election-board-meeting/index.html) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republican-controlled-georgia-election-board-passes-rule-that-may-delay-vote-2024-08-19/) / [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2024/08/17/experts-pro-officials-could-face-severe-punishments-if-they-refuse-to-certify/) / [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-election-board-vote-certification) / [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/georgia-2024-elections-trump_n_66c3a010e4b00667298af388))

3/ **Robert Kennedy Jr. reportedly plans to drop out of the presidential race and endorse Trump by the end of this week**. Kennedy is set to make a campaign speech addressing "his path forward" on Friday amid discussions with Trump about an endorsement in exchange for a role in his administration. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-plans-speech-path-forward-talk-potentially-backing-trump-rcna167606) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/rfk-jr-plans-drop-presidential-race-end-week/story) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/21/robert-f-kennedy-jr-moves-closer-trump-endorsement/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/politics/rfk-jr-speech-friday/index.html))

4/ **The U.S. economy added far fewer jobs in 2023 and early 2024 than previously reported**. The Labor Department said that the economy created 818,000 fewer jobs from April 2023 through March 2024 ‚Äì the biggest revision to federal jobs data in 15 years. The final revision won‚Äôt be released until February 2025. The revisions are part of an annual process where monthly estimates are reconciled with more accurate but less timely records that are based on state unemployment insurance tax filings and covers nearly all US jobs. "The vast majority" of Federal Reserve officials, [meanwhile](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/fed-minutes-july-2024.html), said it‚Äôs "likely" that they‚Äôll cut interest rates in September after raising them to their highest rate in 23 years.

5/ **A federal judge struck down the Federal Trade Commission‚Äôs ban on noncompete agreements that was set to take effect September 4**. Judge Ada Brown ruled that the agency lacked the authority to issue rules related to unfair methods of competition, which would have prohibited companies from restricting their employees‚Äô ability to work for rivals. "The role of an administrative agency is to do as told by Congress, not to do what the agency think[s] it should do,‚Äù Brown wrote. An estimated 30 million U.S. workers ‚Äì one in five American workers ‚Äì are subject to noncompete agreements that typically prevent workers from joining competing businesses or launching ones of their own.
