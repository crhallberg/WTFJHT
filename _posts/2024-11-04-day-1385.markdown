1/ **Trump, who tried to overturn his 2020 election loss, said he ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have left‚Äù the White House**. ‚ÄúWe did so well,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúso now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.‚Äù Trump has not committed to accepting the 2024 election results unless he wins, baselessly claimed that the Democrats are ‚Äúdemonic‚Äù and ‚Äúa bunch of cheats,‚Äù and suggested that Kamala Harris is nothing more than a ‚Äúvessel.‚Äù Trump also complained about a new poll that shows him lagging behind in Iowa, a state he twice carried, saying ‚ÄúWe got all this crap going on with the press and with fake stuff and fake polls,‚Äù suggesting that the poll from the Des Moines Register and Mediacom was put out by ‚Äúone of my enemies.‚Äù And, at rally after rally, Trump has urged his supporters to deliver a victory ‚Äútoo big to rig," telling them: ‚ÄúThe only thing that can stop us is the cheating. It‚Äôs the only thing that can stop us." In 2020, Trump prematurely declared victory from the White House, launched a legal and political effort to overturn his loss, which resulted in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Since then, Congress has passed the Electoral Count Reform Act, which makes it harder to stop the certification of the results by Congress on Jan. 6, which Trump tried to do four years ago.

2/ **Trump suggested that Liz Cheney should have guns ‚Äútrained on her face," wondering how his prominent Republican critic would fare ‚Äúwith a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her.‚Äù** During an interview with Tucker Carlson, Trump said Cheney "is a very dumb individual, very dumb. She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK? Let's see how she feels about it, you know when the guns are trained on her face." Cheney responded in a post on social media that ‚Äúthis is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.‚Äù Kamala Harris, meanwhile, said Trump‚Äôs violent rhetoric about Cheney ‚Äúmust be disqualifying. Anyone who wants to be president of the United States who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/trump-liz-cheney-tucker-carlson.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/01/liz-cheney-trump-guns-shooting/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/01/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/harris-calls-out-trump-00186804) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-01/trump-invokes-violent-rhetoric-against-cheney-drawing-blowback) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/01/g-s1-31443/2024-election-trump-harris-cheney) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/01/trump-liz-cheney-guns-trained) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-attacks-liz-cheney-war-hawk-guns-trained-on-her-face/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/01/politics/donald-trump-liz-cheney-war-hawk-battle/))

3/ **Trump said he wouldn't "mind" if someone had to "shoot through the fake news" to get to him**. Trump made the remark while complaining about the bulletproof glass surrounding him onstage, saying: ‚ÄúI have this piece of glass here. But all we have really over here is the fake news, right? And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don‚Äôt mind that so much. I don‚Äôt mind. I don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs campaign, meanwhile, denied that Trump was wishing harm upon the media, but instead implying that the media was in danger and ‚Äúshould have had a glass protective shield, also.‚Äù ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/03/donald-trump-rally-fake-news-00186979) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/11/03/trump-rally-media-shooting/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/03/trump-pennsylvania-rally-media-shooting) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-kamala-harris-presidential-election-a310fbc211ad8f0f5e290547ec284187))

4/ **Trump didn‚Äôt rule out banning vaccines if he becomes president and said Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan to remove fluoride from public water "sounds OK to me."** Trump said Kennedy Jr. would have a ‚Äúbig role in the administration‚Äù if he wins, calling the conspiracy theorists and vaccine skeptic a "very talented guy" who "has strong views." Major public health groups, including the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC,  support water fluoridation, citing studies showing that the mineral has reduced dental decay by at least 25%. The treatment of public water with small amounts of fluoride has been hailed as one of the most important public health interventions of the past century. Nevertheless, Kennedy Jr. said that among the first acts of a second Trump administration would be to ‚Äúadvise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.‚Äù ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-banning-vaccines-president-rfk-fluoride-rcna178570) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/trump-rfk-jr-vaccines-fluoride.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/03/rfk-jr-trump-fluoride-water/))

5/ **House Speaker Mike Johnson said Republicans ‚Äúprobably will‚Äù try to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act if they control Congress and Trump wins the White House**. The CHIPS and Science Act was passed in 2022 and will invest more than $200 billion over a five-year period to help the U.S. regain a leading position in semiconductor chip manufacturing. So far, the CHIPS act has [allocated](https://x.com/mattcorridoni/status/1852477808909373858) $19.5 billion to Arizona, $75 million to Georgia, $325 million to Michigan, $750 million to North Carolina, and $93 million to Pennsylvania. Johnson later said he "misheard the question." Kamala Harris, meanwhile, said: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be clear about why he walked it back: Because it‚Äôs not popular, and their agenda is not popular. It is my plan and intention to continue to invest in American manufacturing, the work being done by American workers upholding and lifting up good union jobs.‚Äù Last week, Johnson said there would be ‚Äúno Obamacare‚Äù if Trump won the White House, prompting the Trump campaign to issue a statement that repealing the Affordable Care Act isn‚Äôt a policy position. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/01/politics/johnson-chips-act/index.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/mike-johnson-chips-act-d5504f76d3aa0d5b401216f3592c9a09) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-02/harris-assails-speaker-over-call-to-repeal-semiconductor-money) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/02/mike-johnson-chips-act-repeal-democrats) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/kamala-harris/harris-slams-mike-johnson-gop-repeal-chips-act-rcna178513))

6/ **At a rally hours before the election, the Republican Party‚Äôs presidential candidate used a microphone holder on his podium to pantomime the act of giving fellatio**. After he experienced microphone problems, Trump asked his supporters: ‚ÄúDo you want to see me knock the hell out of people backstage? I get so angry. I‚Äôm up here seething. I‚Äôm seething, I‚Äôm working my ass off with this stupid mic. I‚Äôm blowing out my left arm, now I‚Äôm going to blow out my right arm and I‚Äôm blowing out my damn throat too because of these stupid people.‚Äù Trump then took the microphone off the stand and began simulating fellatio.
