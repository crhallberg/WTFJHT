1/ **The Senate announced a bipartisan deal to keep the government open through mid-November and provide $6 billion in assistance to Ukraine**. The stopgap measure to avert an Oct. 1 shutdown still needs to clear several procedural hurdles before full Senate approval. It then needs to overcome gridlock in the Republican-controlled House, where conservatives have threatened to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker and delay the bill over Ukraine funding.

2/ **The Supreme Court – for the second time in three months – rejected Alabama’s request to use a congressional map that includes only one majority-Black district**. In June, the court ruled that Alabama's Republican-drawn congressional map violated the Voting Rights Act and ordered the state to redraw its seven-seat congressional map to include a second majority-Black district or “something quite close to it.” 27% of the state's voting population is Black. A court-appointed special master submitted proposals for three districting plans yesterday, each of which would create a second majority- or near-majority-Black district. The three-judge panel is scheduled to meet next week to choose one.

3/ **Biden urged striking auto workers to “stick with it” during a picket line visit at a General Motors facility in Detroit**, marking the first time a sitting president has joined a picket line. "You deserve what you earned, and you've earned a hell of a lot more than you're getting paid now," Biden told the workers. The strike is now in its 12th day and centers on a 36% wage increase, a return to traditional pensions, retiree health care, and a 32-hour workweek. The United Auto Workers represents 146,000 workers at General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler’s parent company Stellantis.

4/ **The Federal Trade Commission and 17 states sued Amazon**, alleging that the company violated antitrust laws to keep prices artificially high, lock sellers into its platform, and harm its rivals. The FTC argues that Amazon "uses a set of interlocking anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power" by punishing sellers for offering lower prices elsewhere and pressuring them into paying for Amazon's delivery network. “At the very least, any relief would require that the company halt those tactics,” FTC Chair Lina Khan said. “Effective relief also needs to be restoring competition to this market, which we’ll be asking the judge to do as well.” If the FTC suit is successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion company.

5/ **A judge ruled that Trump, Trump Jr., Eric Trump and the Trump Organization fraudulently inflated the value of assets to obtain favorable loans and lower insurance premiums**. Judge Arthur Engoron, ruling in a civil lawsuit brought by Attorney General Letitia James, ordered that some of Trump’s business licenses be rescinded. As a result, the Trump Organization and some of its sister companies will be sent into receivership where a court-appointed officer will manage the dissolution of the canceled LLCs. Engoron’s ruling, however, didn't settle six other issues in the case, which is scheduled to go to trial on Oct. 2. The trial will now focus on allegations related to falsification of business records, issuing false financial statements, insurance fraud, and conspiracy. James is seeking $250 million in damages in the case.

6/ **Trump claimed he's being "unconstitutionally silence[d]" by special counsel Jack Smith**, who requested a "narrowly tailored" gag order in the election interference case. After Trump tried to "undermine confidence in the criminal justice system and prejudice the jury pool," Smith asked a federal judge to bar Trump from further making statements "regarding the identity, testimony, or credibility of prospective witnesses," and "about any party, witness, attorney, court personnel, or potential jurors that are disparaging and inflammatory, or intimidating." Trump claims that federal prosecutors are seeking to "muzzle" him “during the most important months of his campaign” for president. Trump, meanwhile, has continued to attack Smith online, calling him "deranged," and has previously called U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan "very biased & unfair," and accused her of being a "radical Obama hack."
