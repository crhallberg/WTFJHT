1/ **Johnson and Johnson‚Äôs single-dose Covid-19 vaccine was 66% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe illness in a global study**. In the U.S., the vaccine was 72% effective, but the efficacy rate dropped to 57% in South Africa, where a highly contagious variant is driving new cases. The vaccine was particularly effective at stopping severe disease in all regions, preventing 85% of severe infections and 100% of hospitalizations and deaths. Johnson and Johnson said it planned to apply for emergency authorization of its vaccine from the FDA, putting it on track to receive clearance later in February.

2/ **The Trump administration spent $200 million to send more than 8,700 ventilators to countries around the world last year with no way to keep track of where they ended up**.

* **A Republican Arizona lawmaker introduced a bill that would give the state Legislature the ability to revoke the secretary of state's election certification at any time before the presidential inauguration**.

* **Some House lawmakers are privately refusing to work with each other**, as Democratic leaders are putting pressure on the Republican leadership to denounce Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who endorsed violence against members of Congress.
