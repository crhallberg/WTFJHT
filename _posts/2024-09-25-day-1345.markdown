1/ **The House passed a short-term spending bill to avert a government shutdown**. Speaker Mike Johnson again relied on Democrats ‚Äì¬†not his own Republican majority ‚Äì to supply the votes needed to fund the government through Dec. 20. The vote was 341-82, with all opposition coming from Republicans. The Senate is expected to pass the three-month spending patch tonight.

2/ **U.S. intelligence officials briefed Trump about the ‚Äúreal and specific threats" by Iran to assassinate him** as part of ‚Äúan effort to destabilize and sow chaos.‚Äù According to Trump‚Äôs campaign, intelligence officials ‚Äúhave identified that these continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months.‚Äù Secretary of State Antony Blinken added that the U.S. is ‚Äúintensely tracking‚Äù an ongoing threat by Iran against current and former U.S. officials. Since Trump‚Äôs 2020 [authorization](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2020/01/05/day-1081/#1-trump-authorized-a-drone-strike-at) of a drone strike the Baghdad International Airport that killed Qasem Soleimani, Iran‚Äôs top security and intelligence commander, Iran has repeatedly vowed "severe revenge" on those responsible. Trump, meanwhile, posted on his personal social media platform ‚ÄúBig threats on my life by Iran [...] An attack on a former President is a Death Wish for the attacker!‚Äù Separately, the Senate unanimously passed a bill guaranteeing that Trump and Kamala Harris receive the same level of Secret Service protection as a sitting president. It now goes to Biden‚Äôs desk for his signature. The Harris campaign office in Arizona, [meanwhile](https://abcnews.go.com/US/harris-campaign-office-arizona-damaged-apparent-gunfire-police/story?id=114077756), was shot at early Monday morning ‚Äì the second apparent gun attack in a week.

* **Judge Aileen Cannon ‚Äî a Trump appointee ‚Äî was randomly assigned the attempted assassination case**. Cannon presided over ‚Äî and threw out ‚Äî the criminal classified documents case the Justice Department brought against Trump.

3/ **A panel of Trump-appointed U.S. Court of Appeals judges heard oral arguments over a Republican challenge to a Mississippi law that allows mail ballots to be counted if they arrive within five days of an election** as long as they‚Äôre postmarked by that date.While Mississippi is a reliably Republican state, the case is part of a nationwide effort by Trump and Republicans to disqualify mail ballots. The case is expected to reach the Supreme Court before election day, which would affect all states, including the roughly 20 states that count mail ballots that arrive after Election Day but are postmarked on or before. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/24/mississippi-mail-ballots-trump/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/conservative-appeals-court-judges-heard-mississippi-case-peel/story?id=114045219) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-24/late-arriving-2024-ballots-challenged-by-gop-at-appeals-court) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/24/politics/mississippi-mail-in-ballots-5th-circuit/index.html))

4/ **Trump told "lonely" women that he‚Äôs their ‚Äúprotector‚Äù and that they‚Äôll ‚Äúno longer be thinking about abortion‚Äù if he wins in November**. During a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed that women "are more stressed and depressed and unhappy [...] and are less optimistic and confident in the future than they were four years ago," adding that "I will fix all of that and fast [...] I am your protector. I want to be your protector." Despite Trump having repeatedly taken credit for the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, he continued: "You will no longer be abandoned, lonely, or scared. You will no longer be in danger. You‚Äôre not going to be in danger any longer. You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today. You will be protected, and I will be your protector. Women will be happy, healthy, confident, and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion!" Last year, Trump was found liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll. He has also previously been recorded bragging about sexually assaulting women.
