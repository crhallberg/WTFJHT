1/ **After 22 days and three failed nominees, House Republicans elected a speaker to replace Kevin McCarthy**. The House voted 220-209 to elect Mike Johnson as speaker – with all Republicans voting for Johnson and all Democrats voting for Hakeem Jeffries. “The people’s House is back in business,” Johnson said after taking the gavel. Johnson, who served on Trump’s defense team during his first impeachment trial, voted against certifying the 2020 election and led the amicus brief supporting a Texas lawsuit seeking to invalidate the results in four swing states Biden won. The lawsuit cited widespread voter fraud, which did not occur. The House has been unable to conduct routine business since Republicans ousted McCarthy for working with Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill to avert a shutdown. Johnson will immediately need to pass a measure to fund the government ahead of a Nov. 17 shutdown, and act on emergency aid for Israel, Ukraine, and the southern border.

2/ **Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was “preparing for a ground incursion” of the Gaza Strip to “exact the full price from the murderers.”** Netanyahu, however, [agreed](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-battles-on-multiple-fronts-as-conflict-risks-spreading-a5e537ec) to a Biden administration [request](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/biden-calls-for-two-state-solution-following-israel-hamas-war?sref=MIBMEEoj) to hold off on sending tanks and soldiers into Gaza to free more hostages, allow for the arrival of humanitarian aid into enclave, and to give the Pentagon time to deploy nearly a dozen air-defense systems to protect U.S. troops in the region. While Biden reiterated Israel’s right to defend itself, he [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/biden-calls-for-two-state-solution-following-israel-hamas-war?sref=MIBMEEoj) for a two-state solution, [saying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/25/us-fears-escalation-israel-gaza-war/) there must be “a vision of what comes next" because Israelis and Palestinians "equally deserve to live side-by-side in safety, dignity and peace." The United Nations, meanwhile, warned that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached an "unprecedented point," as hospitals have shut down and clean water has "virtually run out." The World Health Organization reported that 12 of 35 hospitals in Gaza were not functioning, and that seven major hospitals were well over capacity. When the U.N. called for a humanitarian cease-fire, a top Israeli diplomat said it was time to teach the world body "a lesson." Russia and China also vetoed a U.S.-led U.N. Security Council draft resolution condemning the Hamas attack, called for the release of hostages, and for humanitarian aid for Gaza.

3/ **Trump was fined $10,000 for – again – violating the gag order in his New York state’s $250 million civil fraud trial**. Judge Arthur Engoron ordered Trump to the witness stand to face questioning under oath about comments he made earlier in the day that “this judge is a very partisan judge with a person who’s very partisan sitting alongside of him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is.” Trump claimed he was referring to the witness testifying, Michael Cohen, and not Engoron's law clerk, who sits next to him. Engoron said he found Trump's testimony "not credible" and fined him $10,000, saying “Don’t do it again or it will be worse.” This is the second time Engoron has fined Trump for violating the gag order, which prohibits him from speaking about any members of the court staff.

4/ **Mark Meadows was granted immunity in special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election**. Meadows has reportedly met with federal prosecutors at least three times, including once before a federal grand jury, providing testimony that he didn't believe the election was stolen and that Trump was being “dishonest” when he claimed victory when polls first closed on Nov. 3, 2020. Meadows also told Smith's team that he repeatedly told Trump following election that the allegations of voter fraud were baseless. Trump responded to the report on his personal social media platform claiming that “Mark Meadows NEVER told me that allegations of significant fraud (about the RIGGED Election!) were baseless. He certainly didn’t say that in his book!” ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/chief-staff-mark-meadows-granted-immunity-tells-special/story?id=104231281) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/politics/mark-meadows/index.html))
