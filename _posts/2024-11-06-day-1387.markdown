1/ **America elected the first convicted felon to serve as president of the United States**. Trump – the twice-impeached, four-times indicted, once-defeated former president – overcame 34 felony convictions, 88 criminal charges, accusations of insurrection as part of his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, civil lawsuit judgments totaling more than a half-billion dollars, allegations by his entire first-term cabinet that he’s unfit to serve, his openly fascist intentions, the overturning of Roe v. Wade, his failed response to the Covid-19 pandemic that led to more than 400,000 deaths from a virus he repeatedly claimed was "going to disappear," his repeated overt acts of racism, at least 26 public accusations of rape, kissing, and groping without consent, his promises to prosecute his political opponents, and the threats encapsulated by the Project 2025 agenda, to become the nation’s 47th president. Trump is the second president — and the first since Grover Cleveland in the 19th century — to retake the White House after a reelection defeat. And, at the age of 78, Trump is the oldest man ever elected president – breaking a record held by Biden, whose mental competence Trump repeatedly savaged. “We just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America,” Trump said in his victory speech. He declared he was the leader of “the greatest political movement of all time” and that he would take office with an “unprecedented and powerful mandate” while promising “the strongest economy, the most secure borders and safest cities.” He added: “This is a magnificent victory for the American people \[...\] This will truly be the golden age of America.” Kamala Harris, meanwhile, conceded Wednesday, telling Trump she'd ensure a peaceful transfer of power from the Biden administration to his. “While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign," Harris said in her concession speech. "The fight, the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness and the dignity of all people, a fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best, that is a fight I will never give up.” Trump ended up with at least 292 electoral votes after clinching wins in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin. Harris has won at least 226 votes. Alaska, Arizona, and Nevada are still counting votes. Trump is currently on pace to win the national popular vote, too. Trump defeated Kamala Harris, in part, by promising to curb inflation, crack down on undocumented immigrants, and end overseas conflicts. He achieved an electoral college majority by maintaining his majorities with men and White voters without college degrees, while over-performing with key Democratic groups, including Latinos and young voters. Although Harris won Latinos by about 14 points, it was much narrower than Biden’s 33-point margin in 2020, and Clinton’s 38-points in 2016. Latino men, in particular, have moved significantly since 2016: Clinton won their support by 31 points, Biden won by a 23-point margin in 2020, and Trump won by a 12-point margin in 2024. Harris also lost support among the youngest voters: In 2020, Biden won 18-to-29-year-olds by 24 points compared to 11 points for Harris in 2024. Among 30-44-year-olds, Biden won their support by 6 points compared to 1 point for Harris.

2/ **Republicans gained control of the Senate, while the House is still up for grabs**. Senate Republicans flipped seats in West Virginia, Montana, and Ohio to secure at least a 51-seat majority. To gain control of the House, Democrats need to flip four seats from Republicans, while holding all of their own. Republicans entered Election Day holding a 220-212 majority. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/house-senate-election-results-majority-democrats-republicans-congress-rcna176115) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/congress-elections-house-senate-harris-trump-94b49277db2a5c21f23236794a36afa6) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/senate-election-results-2024/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/republicans-senate-control.html))

3/ **Special Counsel Jack Smith is preparing to drop the two federal criminal cases against Trump to comply with long-standing Justice Department policy that a sitting president can’t be prosecuted**. The department policy put in place in 2000 states: “The indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.” Smith charged Trump with illegally trying to remain in office after the 2020 election. In a separate case, Smith charged Trump with illegally retaining classified documents and obstructing federal efforts to retrieve them after he left the White House. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump, dismissed the documents case in July on the ground that Attorney General Merrick Garland had no authority to appoint Smith in the first place. Smith has been appealing that decision. Trump recently said he’d fire Smith “within two seconds” after he returned to the White House.

4/ **Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister while the world’s attention was focused on the U.S. election**. Yoav Gallant, one of the most vocal and prominent critics of Netanyahu’s war strategy, was pushing for a ceasefire in exchange for a hostage release deal. Gallant’s firing removed the main advocate for such a deal. Netanyahu has called for “total victory” in the war, and rejected pressure domestically and from the U.S. to accept a ceasefire deal. “In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defense,” Netanyahu said. “Unfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the minister of defense.” Harris was widely expected to continue the Biden administration’s policies toward Israel, which included supplying Israel with weapons, but periodically slowing their shipment to pressure Israel into providing more humanitarian aid to Gazans. Trump, however, is widely believed to be less critical of Netanyahu’s policies.

5/ **North Korean troops deployed to Russia have come under Ukrainian fire in Kursk**. A U.S. official said a significant number of North Korean troops were killed in the "small engagement." President Volodymyr Zelensky called the development a “new page of instability in the world.” North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, sent about 10,000 soldiers to Russia to bolster forces in the Kursk region, a Russian border area where Ukrainian forces seized territory in a surprise attack over the summer. Russia initially provided the North Korean troops with “training of a one-month period” with artillery and drones, but that has been shortened to one week “so that they can get engagement on the battlefield.” The Pentagon, [meanwhile](https://www.politico.eu/article/pentagon-north-korean-troops-pornography-vladimir-putin-russia-war-in-ukraine/), said it was unable to confirm reports that North Korean troops are “gorging on pornography” with their new, expansive internet access in Russia.
