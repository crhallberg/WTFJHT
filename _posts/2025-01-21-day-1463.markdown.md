***Orientation and expectation setting**: Ok, so this week is undeniably a weird one – there’s a lot happening, and it’s moving fast. You could call it the “shock and awe in national politics” that I’ve been urging people to “read in moderation” for the past eight years...*

*Anyway, if you’re new here my job is to wrangle this chaos into a clear, concise once-a-day newsletter that keeps you informed about the latest political developments without letting it dominate your life. Goodbye doomscrolling!* 

*Practically speaking, WTF Just Happened Today? covers U.S. political news through the lens of the executive branch, specifically the president, with a secondary focus on the legislative and judicial branches. This scope is intentionally narrow, and I recognize people may expect more. But here’s why: Our time to consume news is scarce, yet the media environment is optimized to generate an abundance of news. That’s the tension I aim to resolve by distilling the news into a manageable, first draft of history, rooted in verified facts from multiple trusted sources. Importantly, each edition has a distinct end, providing a clear conclusion to the day's events. This finite ending serves as an antidote to the endless, addictive cycle of pull-to-refresh doomscrolling on our tiny screens, allowing readers to feel informed without feeling overwhelmed.*

*Of course, weeks like this — packed with nonstop developments — push the limits of WTFJHT’s usual clear and compact format. But the reality is, each of these stories matters because they directly impact real people in real ways.* 

*I’m glad you’re here.*

1/ **Trump marked the start of his second presidential term by signing a series of executive actions targeting immigration, the federal workforce, climate policy, and government structure, while granting pardons to Jan. 6 rioters**. The executive orders included rescinding 78 Biden-era policies, ending birthright citizenship, declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, suspending refugee resettlement, and reinstating the "Remain in Mexico" policy. Trump also pardoned or commuted sentences for more than 1,500 individuals involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, including prominent group leaders. Other orders withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, reinstated the federal death penalty, froze federal hiring, and established a Department of Government Efficiency.

2/ **Trump issued a sweeping executive order pardoning nearly 1,600 people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and commuting the sentences of 14 others**, including members of extremist groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. The move effectively ended the Justice Department’s four-year investigation into the riot and dismissed hundreds of pending cases. Among those pardoned were Enrique Tarrio, Proud Boys leader, and Stewart Rhodes, Oath Keepers founder – both convicted of seditious conspiracy. Tarrio had been sentenced to 22 years in the federal penitentiary, while Rhodes had been sentenced to 18 years in prison after a judge said he presented "an ongoing threat and peril to this country [...] and to the very fabric of our democracy." The pardons fulfilled a major campaign promise by Trump, who framed Jan. 6 defendants as “patriots” and “hostages.” The action erased sentences for violent crimes, including assaults on police officers, sparking criticism from former investigators, judges, and officers injured in the riot. Trump also directed the Justice Department to halt prosecutions and release those still incarcerated. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-36809/trump-pardons-january-6-riot) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-pardons-jan-6.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/01/20/trump-pardons-jan-6-defendants/) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/capitol-jan-6-pardons-trump-justice-department-8ce8b2a8f8cb602d5eaf85ac7b969606) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/20/donald-trump-jan6-pardons-00199532) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/21/trump-pardons-jan-6-defendants) / [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-jan-6-pardons/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-set-pardon-defendants-stormed-capitol-jan-6-2021-rcna187735) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/jan-6-defendants-freed.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/trump-says-he-s-pardoning-nearly-all-capitol-riot-defendants) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-inauguration-president-2025))

* **Republican senators criticized Trump’s pardons of violent Jan. 6 rioters**, calling it a betrayal of law enforcement. Critics like Murkowski and Collins warned it undermines accountability and risks normalizing political violence. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/21/congress/gop-senators-on-trumps-jan-6-pardons-00199689) / [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/21/2025/mcconnell-criticizes-trumps-broad-pardon-of-capitol-riot-defendants))

3/ **At least 18 states and two cities sued to block Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented or temporary immigrants**. The order challenges the 14th Amendment, which guarantees U.S. citizenship to anyone born on American soil, regardless of their parents’ immigration status. Trump’s order is set to take effect next month. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/trump-birthright-citizenship.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/birthright-citizenship-trump-executive-order-immigrants-fc7dd75ba1fb0a10f56b2a85b92dbe53) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/21/trump-birthright-citizenship-14th-amendment) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/democratic-states-sue-birthright-citizenship-trump/index.html))

4/ **Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, declared an energy emergency, and prioritized fossil fuel production over renewable energy**. Trump’s executive orders also expanded oil drilling on public lands and halted federal support for wind farms and electric vehicles. He paused spending from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, effectively stalling clean energy initiatives, and dissolved programs like the American Climate Corps. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/climate/trump-emergency-oil-gas.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-paris-agreement-climate-change-788907bb89fe307a964be757313cdfb0) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/trump-orders-agencies-to-halt-spending-from-biden-s-climate-law))

* **Trump issued an executive order to roll back policies and subsidies favoring electric vehicles**. The directive halts federal funding for EV charging stations and targets state rules, like California’s, that require increasing sales of zero-emission vehicles. Automakers, who have already invested heavily in EV production, are unlikely to change course, but the order could slow the transition to cleaner cars. ([Bloomberg](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/us/trump-executive-orders) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/20/us/trump-executive-orders))

5/ **Trump ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the World Health Organization**, citing alleged mishandling of global health crises and deference to China. The withdrawal will take one year to finalize and pauses U.S. funding, which accounts for about 20% of the WHO’s budget. The WHO called for the U.S. to reconsider, highlighting decades of collaboration that have eradicated diseases like smallpox and nearly ended polio. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/20/g-s1-42918/trump-world-health-organization-withdrawal) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-world-health-organization.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/trump-orders-us-to-withdraw-from-world-health-organization) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/21/trump-executive-orders-challenges-lawsuits/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5097932-world-health-organization-trump-withdrawal-response/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/21/trump-world-health-organization-executive-order))

6/ **Trump banned federal agencies from engaging in or funding actions that could "unconstitutionally abridge" Americans’ free speech**. The order halts years of coordination between government officials and tech companies to address misinformation about elections, public health, and disasters. It also directs the attorney general to investigate alleged censorship during the Biden administration and calls for a report on the findings. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/20/trump-free-speech-executive-order-censorship/))

7/ **Trump rolled back transgender protections and federal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, while restricting gender definitions to biological sex – male and female – as unchangeable realities**. The executive orders mandate federal agencies limit gender markers on official documents like passports and visas, prohibit taxpayer funding for gender-affirming care, and bar funding for organizations promoting "gender ideology." Transgender individuals in federal prisons may face relocation based on birth-assigned sex and lose access to gender-affirming treatments. Separately, the administration ordered the termination of DEI roles and programs across federal agencies, calling them discriminatory and wasteful. ([HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-executive-order-transgender_n_678e8352e4b04a2f42526cd0) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/trump-signs-executive-order-to-cancel-federal-dei-requirements) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/20/donald-trump-inauguration-day-news-updates-analysis/trump-repeals-transgender-troops-rule-00199577) [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/trump-declares-war-on-transgender-people/))

8/ **Trump issued an executive order to delay TikTok’s ban by 75 days**, granting the app and its Chinese parent ByteDance more time to find a buyer and address U.S. national security concerns. The federal law requiring TikTok’s sale or ban took effect on Sunday, but Trump instructed the attorney general not to enforce penalties against app stores or service providers during the delay even though the Supreme Court upheld the law. TikTok briefly ceased operations in the U.S. but resumed service after Trump’s announcement, though its long-term future remains uncertain. Trump, meanwhile, suggested a potential joint venture where “the U.S. should be entitled to get half of TikTok” if a deal for the app is reached. He said he thought TikTok would be worth $1 trillion under American ownership. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/trump-halts-tiktok-ban-giving-app-extra-time-to-find-a-buyer) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/20/trump-tiktok-extension-executive-order-00199545) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/technology/trump-tiktok-ban-delay-executive-order.html))

9/ **Trump issued an executive order requiring federal employees to return to in-person work five days a week and removing job protections for senior government workers**. The order ends remote work arrangements across the executive branch, with limited exemptions granted by department heads. It also reinstates policies making it easier to fire career civil servants and freezes federal hiring. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-orders-all-federal-workers-back-to-office-5-days-a-week/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/20/donald-trump-inauguration-day-news-updates-analysis/a-government-hiring-freeze-and-end-to-remote-work-00199548))

10/ **Trump revoked a Biden-era executive order that directed federal agencies to promote voter registration**. Biden’s 2021 order aimed to help eligible voters sign up through initiatives such as updated voter guides, mailers, and registration assistance at federal offices like Veterans Affairs facilities. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/nx-s1-5169190/biden-voter-registration-executive-order))

### ✏️ Notables. 

1. **Elon Musk – the world’s richest man – twice made what looked like the Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration rally**. During his speech, Musk slapped his hand to his chest before extending his arm outward in a stiff diagonal motion, a gesture he repeated. Critics, including historians and public figures, condemned the actions as symbolic of hate and extremism, while far-right communities online interpreted it as a direct signal of alignment. Musk, meanwhile, has not directly or publicly denied that it was a Nazi salute or apologized for any misunderstanding. The Anti-Defamation League, however, called the gesture an "awkward moment of enthusiasm." ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/20/trump-elon-musk-salute) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/elon-musk-hand-gesture-speech.html) / [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/neo-nazis-love-elon-musk-nazi-like-salutes-trumps-inauguration/) / [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-salute-reaction-right-wing-extremists-1235241866/) / [New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/190464/did-elon-musk-nazi-salute-trump-inauguration) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/20/donald-trump-inauguration-day-news-updates-analysis/challenging-trump-on-citizenship-00199593) / [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/01/musk-trump-inauguration-salute/681390/))

2. **The Senate passed the Laken Riley Act, expanding detention for undocumented migrants charged with crimes**. The bill passed with bipartisan support as 12 Democrats joined Republicans in a 64-35 vote to expand mandatory detention for migrants charged with offenses like theft and assaulting law enforcement officers. The House will vote this week, delivering Trump an immediate win on immigration. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/20/donald-trump-inauguration-day-news-updates-analysis/laken-riley-act-senate-00199518) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/congress-immigration-laken-riley-trump-4011a282775d58d509d953a9830aa367) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/senate-passes-border-crackdown-bill.html))

3. **The Senate unanimously confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of state**, making him the first Cabinet member of Trump’s second term. Rubio received a 99-0 vote. He pledged to address key global challenges, including ending the Ukraine war, strengthening U.S. alliances, and countering China’s influence. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-20/rubio-confirmed-secretary-of-state-first-trump-pick-approved) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-cabinet-marco-rubio-secretary-of-state-nominee-39c378e19d0327a7f091f302daf8ca3e) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-nominees-senate-vote-confirm-rcna187974))

4. **The Senate Armed Services Committee voted along party lines to advance Pete Hegseth’s nomination for defense secretary**, setting up a contentious full Senate vote later this week. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and Army veteran, faces allegations of sexual misconduct, alcohol abuse, and limited qualifications for the role, all of which he denies. Hegseth is likely to be confirmed, though the process may extend into midweek due to procedural delays. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5096499-pete-hegseth-advances-defense-secretary/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/20/donald-trump-inauguration-day-news-updates-analysis/senate-committee-advances-hegseth-to-lead-pentagon-00199500) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-armed-services-committee-pete-hegseth-vote-defense-secretary-rcna188390))

5. **Senators received an affidavit from Danielle Hegseth, the former sister-in-law of Pete Hegseth, alleging that his behavior caused his second wife, Samantha Hegseth, to fear for her safety during their marriage**. Danielle claimed Hegseth displayed erratic and aggressive behavior, which she reported to the FBI during its background investigation. Samantha denied the allegations, stating there was no physical abuse in her marriage and emphasizing that she would not speak further on the matter. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/senators-received-affidavit-containing-new-allegations-pete-hegseth-de-rcna188342) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/pete-hegseth-affidavit-witness-drunk-passing-out-e216ca85) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/politics/hegseth-senators-affidavit.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/21/hegseth-new-allegations-00199730))

6. **Trump missed his self-imposed 24-hour deadline to end the war in Ukraine**. Despite promising to broker peace quickly, Trump has made no public moves toward resolving the conflict, and his inauguration speech omitted mention of Ukraine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged peace efforts would require concessions from Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Europe to take greater responsibility for its own security. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-misses-deadline-to-end-ukraine-war/index.html))

7. **Trump issued an executive order to expedite federal permitting for critical infrastructure projects**, aiming to eliminate delays and attract investment. The directive instructs agencies to streamline approvals using methods like "permit by rule" and emergency powers while exploring legislative limits on environmental reviews. Business groups praised the move, but legal and regulatory hurdles tied to longstanding laws like the National Environmental Policy Act remain. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/trump-orders-plan-to-speed-permitting-of-projects-across-us))

8. **Trump’s SEC launched a “crypto task force” to create regulations for the $3.7 trillion cryptocurrency industry**. Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce aim to address issues like coin registration and market integrity while encouraging innovation. Bitcoin rose 2.4% following the announcement. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/trumps-sec-launching-crypto-task-force-to-develop-clear-regulations-for-industry.html))

9. **Panama formally rejected Trump’s inaugural remarks about “taking back” the Panama Canal**. In a letter to U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, Panama reaffirmed its sovereignty over the canal, which the U.S. handed over in 1999. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/21/us/panama-canal-trump-un.html))

10. **Trump effectively shut down the U.S.-Mexico border for asylum seekers by canceling the CBP One app and suspending refugee resettlement**, leaving thousands of migrants stranded. This move ends nearly all legal pathways for asylum, with pre-scheduled appointments abruptly canceled and migrants left in despair. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-us-mexico-border-migrants/index.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-43855/trump-inauguration-border-asylum-app-cbpone))

11. **Trump is pushing for an early renegotiation of the USMCA trade agreement**, using the threat of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico to pressure both countries. His focus includes changing automotive rules to relocate production to the U.S., which has raised concerns about economic disruption among trade partners. Canada and Mexico are considering retaliatory measures, including tariffs on U.S. goods, as businesses prepare for potential fallout.

### 👑 Portrait of a president.

1. **Trump’s second inauguration speech, delivered on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, centered on self-promotion, grievance, and promises to impose a nationalist and reactionary agenda**. Trump declared his presidency divinely ordained and described his return to power as a "Liberation Day" from Biden's leadership, while blaming the previous administration for America's "decline." His speech highlighted familiar themes of immigration crackdowns, cultural conservatism, and symbolic changes like renaming the Gulf of Mexico, while downplaying pressing issues like the ongoing war in Europe. The ceremony also underscored the dominance of tech and corporate elites in Trump’s second administration, with figures like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos prominently featured. Critics noted the dissonance of Trump’s return to power in the Capitol, the site of the January 6th insurrection, and his plans to pardon some of those involved in the attack. ([New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/donald-trumps-inaugural-day-of-vindication))

2. **Trump began his second term as president with contrasting inaugural speeches emphasizing both policy goals and personal grievances**. In a formal address at the Capitol rotunda, he focused on inflation, immigration, and energy, while later, in Emancipation Hall, he called the 2020 election “rigged” and attacked political rivals. On his first day, he signed a series of executive orders, including declaring a border emergency, ending the asylum process, pardoning January 6 rioters, and halting federal diversity initiatives. His administration appears torn between a legacy-driven policy agenda and efforts to consolidate power and settle personal scores, setting up a turbulent path for the coming term. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-01-21/who-s-influencing-trump-dueling-visions-key-players-to-shape-his-new-term))

3. **In his second inaugural address, Trump framed his presidency as a mission to impose a reactionary vision of America**, invoking themes of religious destiny, cultural conservatism, and nationalist symbolism. Trump pledged to tackle immigration with aggressive measures, reject social progressivism, and restore traditional values, reinforcing the ideology of “Redemption” that historically countered the Reconstruction era’s push for equality. He declared his presidency divinely ordained and aligned himself with billionaire elites, solidifying their support. ([New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/190452/trump-inaugural-address-rotunda-redemption-armageddon))

4. **Trump’s second inauguration highlighted a newfound alliance with tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk**, who have aligned themselves with the president despite previous clashes. High-profile tech leaders attended Trump’s inauguration and exclusive events, signaling a shift from opposition to courtship as they seek influence over federal policies affecting their industries. The relationship raises concerns about the growing influence of wealth on governance, with tech executives potentially benefiting from their proximity to power while risking Trump’s unpredictable retaliation if they fall out of favor. Critics warn this dynamic could accelerate the fusion of autocracy and oligarchy in American politics. ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/01/tech-zuckerberg-trump-inauguration-oligarchy/681381/))

5. **Trump and Biden used presidential pardons in unprecedented ways, highlighting a shift toward personalized executive power and raising concerns about democratic decline**. Biden pardoned family members and officials preemptively to shield them from Trump’s administration, while Trump pardoned 1,600 January 6 rioters, blending self-interest with claims of restoring unity. This trend, rooted in historical debates over the pardon power, reflects a shift toward a monarchical presidency, undermining the ideal of equal application of the law. Critics argue these actions reveal the erosion of institutional checks and the growing misuse of presidential authority for partisan purposes. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-21/trump-s-jan-6-pardons-show-decline-of-democracy))

6. **Democrats failed to prevent Trump's return to the presidency, highlighting a lack of effective opposition to his growing influence and extreme agenda**. Following his controversial first term, Trump now leads a more experienced and aggressive movement, solidifying his control over the Republican Party and expanding his base. Democrats relied for years on portraying Trump as a singular threat while failing to offer substantive alternatives, leaving them ill-prepared for his resurgence. The absence of a strong resistance movement, coupled with limited unity among elected Democrats, has amplified the urgency for a new strategy to counter Trumpism. Defeating Trump now requires focusing on actionable policies rather than merely opposing his persona. ([New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/190381/trump-resistance-failed-second-term-democrats))

7. **Trump’s return to the presidency, despite his impeachments, criminal indictments, and role in the Jan. 6 insurrection, was enabled by a systemic collapse of accountability**. Institutions that should have prevented his resurgence either failed, surrendered, or actively supported him, including a far-right Supreme Court, a demoralized Democratic Party, and corporate elites funding his rise. Trump’s platform is marked by authoritarianism, cultural conservatism, and personal grievances, as he assumes control of a GOP-aligned federal government. ([Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-inauguration-2024-win-democrats-failed-1235241327/))
