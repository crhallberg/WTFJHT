1/ **House Republicans rejected their own funding bill after Trump demanded that the government be shut down if legislation requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote isn‚Äôt passed**. Noncitizen voting, however, is already illegal in federal elections, and voter fraud committed by noncitizens is rare and practically nonexistent. The claim that non-citizen voting is a widespread problem has been repeatedly debunked. Lawmakers have until Sept. 30 to extend government funding. "I'm disappointed," Speaker Mike Johnson said after the vote, which he lost by a vote of 220-202. ‚ÄúWe ran the play. It was the best play. It was the right one. And so now we go back to the playbook. We‚Äôll draw up another play and we‚Äôll come up with a solution.‚Äù ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/18/house-bill-government-shutdown-funding/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-vote-funding-bill-shutdown-trump-save-act-rcna171635) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/johnson-suffers-embarrassing-loss-as-bill-to-stop-shutdown-fails) / [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-government-shutdown-congress-save-act-1235106067/))

2/ **Trump criticized the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision to lower interest rates for the first time in four years during a campaign stop at a Bitcoin-themed bar**. He suggested that the central bank was "playing politics" and that the economy must be "very bad." Earlier in the day, the Fed cut rates from 5.25 to 5.50% to a range between 4.75 and 5% in response to the Committee gaining "greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%," and that the "risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance."
