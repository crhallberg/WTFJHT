1/ **A federal judge temporarily blocked Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing the Treasury Department payment systems** and ordered the destruction of “any and all copies of material downloaded from the Treasury Department’s records and systems.” Judge Paul Engelmayer issued the order after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued the Trump administration, arguing that Musk’s team unlawfully accessed personal and financial data of millions of Americans in what they called “the largest data breach in American history.” The lawsuit claims DOGE’s access could allow unauthorized freezes on federal payments, including Social Security and veterans’ benefits, in violation of federal law. Although the Treasury Department insisted that DOGE staffers only had “read-only” access and there was no “tinkering” with the system, Engelmayer said “There is a risk of irreparable harm \[...\] and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.” A hearing is set for Feb. 14 to determine whether the block will remain in place.

* **A judge denied labor unions’ request to block Musk’s DOGE from accessing Labor Department data**, ruling they lacked standing. The decision allows DOGE to review sensitive records, including workplace safety and workers' compensation data, despite concerns over privacy risks.

2/ **A U.S. Treasury threat intelligence report labeled Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency staff "the single greatest insider threat risk the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced"** due to their access to federal payment systems. An internal Treasury email recommended suspending DOGE staff’s access and conducting a review of their activities. Despite previous Treasury assurances that their access was “read-only,” the email warned that at least one DOGE member, Marko Elez, had write access, meaning he could modify critical systems that process trillions in federal payments. Elez was granted full administrative privileges to the Payment Automation Manager, which oversees automation of large-scale federal disbursements, and the Secure Payment System, which processes and authorizes individual federal payments, including Social Security, veterans' benefits, and tax refunds. Elez reportedly made extensive changes to the PAM system before his access was downgraded following media scrutiny.

3/ **Elon Musk will rehire Marko Elez, who resigned from the Department of Government Efficiency after his past tweets advocating racism and eugenics**. Trump and JD Vance publicly supported Elez’s reinstatement, claiming past social media posts should not “ruin a kid’s life” and that journalists should not be rewarded for "trying to destroy people." Meanwhile, Musk called the journalist who reported on Elez’s racist tweets “disgusting and cruel,” and saying she should be “fired immediately.” ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/07/elon-musk-doge-racist-treasury-x-staff.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/06/doge-staffer-resigns-racist-social-media-elon-musk) / [Mediate](https://www.mediaite.com/news/elon-musk-demands-firing-of-disgusting-and-cruel-wsj-reporter-who-uncovered-doge-employees-racist-tweets/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/vance-doge-staffer-racist-posts.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93))

* **The 19-year-old member of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiencywas previously fired from a cybersecurity firm for leaking company secrets**. Edward Coristine later bragged about retaining access to its servers.

4/ **A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from placing 2,700 USAID employees on leave and ordered the reinstatement of 500 others**. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ruled that abruptly sidelining USAID workers could cause “irreparable” harm, particularly for those posted abroad, and scheduled a follow-up hearing for next week. The lawsuit, filed by employee unions, argues that Trump's efforts to gut USAID exceed presidential authority and violate congressional oversight.

5/ **Trump fired Federal Election Commission Chair Ellen Weintraub, but she's refused to step down**. Weintraub received a letter from Trump saying she was “hereby removed” immediately. Weintraub, however, responded that “There’s a legal way to replace FEC commissioners – this isn’t it.” By law, FEC commissioners serve six-year terms and remain in office until a Senate-confirmed replacement takes over.

* **Trump dismissed Archivist of the United States Colleen Shogan**. Trump didn’t cite a reason for removing the official overseeing government records, but Trump previously criticized the National Archives and its role in the Justice Department’s classified documents case against him. The White House has not named a replacement.

6/ **Trump revoked Biden’s security clearance**, saying there was “no need” for Biden to receive classified information. In 2021, Biden blocked Trump from briefings, citing his “erratic behavior” following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-cutting-bidens-access-intelligence-material-rcna191299) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-he-revoked-joe-bidens-security-clearance-6043e6d3) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-security-clearance-revoked-be82cd4f185f01404718fcc69e074fbf) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/08/us/trump-administration-news/trump-biden-security-clearances))

7/ **Trump will sign an executive order reversing Biden’s "ridiculous" plan to phase out single-use plastic straws by 2027**. “BACK TO PLASTIC!” Trump wrote on his social media site, saying paper straws “don’t work.” ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/donald-trump-plastic-straws-014141) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/climate/trump-paper-straws.html) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/07/trump-plastic-straws/78330750007/))
