1/ **A federal judge ruled that Elon Musk’s attempt to unilaterally dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development likely violated the Constitution in "multiple ways,"** but left room for the Trump administration to achieve the same goal through official channels. Judge Theodore Chuang wrote that Musk “exercised significant authority” over the agency despite lacking a formal government appointment. The ruling blocks Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency from taking further action, but doesn’t prevent USAID’s leadership from proceeding with the closure. Chuang called the administration’s claim that Musk had no decision-making authority “highly suspicious,” pointing to Trump’s own statements about putting Musk “in charge.” Musk dismissed the ruling as partisan, responding “indeed” to a Twitter post suggesting it was a partisan ruling by a Democrat-appointed judge.

* **The Trump administration is reinstating over 24,000 fired federal workers after two judges ruled the mass terminations were illegal**. U.S. District Judge James Bredar ordered 18 agencies to reinstate fired workers, while Judge William Alsup issued a similar ruling for six agencies, rejecting claims that the Office of Personnel Management had authority to order the firings. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-says-working-reinstate-24000-fired-federal-worker-rcna196897) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5332139/fired-federal-employees-reinstate-leave) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/17/trump-administration-reinstates-fired-probationary-workers/))

2/ **The Trump administration defied a federal judge’s order halting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, refusing to disclose whether flights carrying suspected Venezuelan gang members departed after the ruling**. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered the Justice Department to submit sealed flight details after government lawyers insisted they hadn’t violated his order. Meanwhile, the Trump administration petitioned an appeals court to remove Boasberg from the case, accusing him of “judicial micromanagement” and claiming he overstepped his authority and engaged in “flagrantly improper” judicial conduct that posed “grave risks” to national security and foreign relations. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-venezuela-deportations-doj-court-order.html) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/doj-refuses-respond-questions-judge-blocked-alien-enemies-act-deportat-rcna196883) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/18/justice-department-venezuelan-migrant-deportations-responses) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331986/deportation-flight-tren-de-aragua-justice-department-boasberg) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/17/trump-court-orders-defy-deportations/) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/trump-doj-says-venezuelan-deportations-didn-t-defy-judge-s-order))

3/ **Trump called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg after he temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelan migrants**. “This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!” Trump wrote on his personal social media platform. In response, House Republicans introduced impeachment articles, claiming Boasberg “overstepped his authority, compromised the impartiality of the judiciary, and created a constitutional crisis.” Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare public rebuke, saying: “Impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.” The Constitution grants lifetime appointments to federal judges, and impeachment is typically reserved for misconduct – not legal rulings. Despite Trump’s push, Congress is unlikely to act, as judicial removal requires a two-thirds Senate vote. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/trump-impeachment-judge-deportations-00235173) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-federal-judges-impeachment-29da1153a9f82106748098a6606fec39) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/john-roberts-donald-trump-impeach-federal-judges-00235742) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/chief-justice-pushes-back-calls-impeach-judges-rule-trump-rcna196922) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/chief-justice-roberts-impeachment-trump.html) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/18/trump-judges-impeach-chief-justice-roberts/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/18/donald-trump-impeach-judge-house-republicans) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/us-chief-justice-calls-impeaching-judges-over-rulings-improper) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/18/justice-roberts-trump-impeach-judge-venezuela) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-insults-federal-judge-amid-legal-battle-deportation/story?id=119909983) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-chief-justice-roberts-calls-judges-impeachment-are-inappropriate-after-trump-2025-03-18/) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/politics/john-roberts-donald-trump-impeachment/index.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/chief-justice-roberts-criticizes-trumps-call-to-impeach-judges-e3b2be89))

4/ **Putin agreed to limited ceasefire that would stop strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, but only if Ukraine does the same**. Putin, however, refused to accept the broader 30-day ceasefire Ukraine had already agreed to, instead insisting that “real peace depends on ending foreign military support to Ukraine.” Trump called the conversation “a very good and productive one,” but Putin’s demand for halting military aid directly contradicts Kyiv’s position and threatens to derail further talks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was not included in the call, cautiously supported stopping energy strikes, but warned that “we need details” and reiterated that Putin has broken past agreements. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-putin-call-ukraine-russia-ceasefire.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/18/trump-putin-call-ukraine-war) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/trump-putin-ukraine-call-00235878) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/18/trump-presidency-news/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-call-zelenskyy-nato-ceasefire-zaporizhzhia-rcna196847) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/politics/trump-putin-ceasefire-russia-ukraine-war/index.html) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-war-ceasefire-call.html) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/trump-and-putin-wrap-phone-call-as-us-pushes-for-ceasefire) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/trump-putin-phone-call-ukraine-russia-ceasefire-73f44bf0))

5/ **The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed as Israeli airstrikes on Gaza killed over 400 people in the deadliest attack since the war began**. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that “This is just the beginning,” adding that “negotiations will only take place under fire.” The strikes followed failed talks over a second phase of the ceasefire, with Israel accusing Hamas of refusing to release hostages and Hamas blaming Israel for “overturning the ceasefire agreement.” The White House, which confirmed Israel had consulted the Trump administration beforehand, said that “Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that “If Hamas does not release all the hostages, the gates of hell will open in Gaza.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/17/world/israel-gaza-airstrikes) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/03/17/israel-hamas-gaza-military-airstrikes/82505920007/) / [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-conducts-strikes-hamas-targets-gaza-army-says-2025-03-18/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/18/israel-gaza-war-resumes-airstrikes-hamas) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/israel-gaza-airstrikes-death-toll-00235043) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/g-s1-54401/israel-launches-deadly-series-of-attack-on-gaza) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/17/israel-hamas-ceasefire-gaza-war-airstrikes/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-hundreds-palestinians-killed-israeli-strikes-gaza-rcna196842) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/live/latest-updates-israel-launches-new-wave-of-airstrikes-across-gaza-after-ceasefire-talks-stall) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/israel-conducts-extensive-strikes-gaza-strip-idf/story?id=119894645) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/middleeast/israel-strikes-gaza-hamas-ceasefire-intl-hnk/index.html) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-launches-renewed-attacks-on-hamas-in-gaza-74776630))

### ✏️ Notables.

1. **The Trump administration is considering eliminating the EPA’s Office of Research and Development**, a move that could result in firing up to 1,155 scientists. The office provides the scientific basis for environmental regulations, and has long been a target of industry groups that oppose stricter pollution controls. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/climate/trump-eliminates-epa-science.html) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/epa-science-layoffs-trump-doge-8a5743b9281e3f82afdf2cdd5f972d5f) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/18/epa-science-office-research-development/) / [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5200544-trump-administration-epa-science-arm-elimination/))

2. **A leaked Social Security Administration memo proposes ending phone-based services to force many people to verify their identity in-person instead**. The memo, signed by acting deputy commissioner Doris Diaz on March 13, contradicts previous SSA claims that only minor phone service changes were planned. If implemented, the policy would require tens of thousands of beneficiaries – many elderly or disabled – to visit field offices already facing staff cuts, long wait times, and closures. ([Popular Information](https://popular.info/p/exclusive-memo-details-trump-plan) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/17/irs-staff-cuts-taxpayer-advocate-service/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/17/social-security-trump-doge) / [New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/192824/donald-trump-ukraine-war-campaign-promise) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/17/social-security-changes-phone-claims-doge/))

3. **Trump claimed that Biden’s pardons – including those for Jan. 6 committee members – “VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT” because they were signed with an autopen**. Yet, he offered no legal justification, and experts were quick to dismiss the claim. Trump later suggested that “It’s not my decision – that’ll be up to a court,” but suggested that those pardoned should “fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level.” ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/autopen-pardons-biden-trump.html) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/17/trump-biden-pardons-autopen-jan-6-committee) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-lays-groundwork-for-investigating-people-pardoned-by-biden-73ee33ad) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-bidens-pardons-jan-6-committee-are-void-used-autopen-rcna196670) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-17/trump-calls-biden-pardons-void-because-of-autopen-usage) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-claims-bidens-pardons-jan-6-committee-void/story?id=119877843) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/17/trump-says-biden-pardons-void-autopen/))

4. **China and Cambodia praised Trump for shutting down the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which funded Voice of America and Radio Free Asia**. Cambodia’s Hun Sen called it a win against “fake news,” while China’s Global Times celebrated the end of a “lie factory.” Russian officials, meanwhile, dismissed the outlets as irrelevant, but acknowledged they had undermined Moscow’s influence. The White House justified the shutdown as cutting “radical propaganda,” but offered no evidence to support the claim. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/trump-closing-voice-of-america-draws-praise-from-china-cambodia) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/china/china-cheers-trump-cut-voice-of-america-intl-hnk/) / [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/moscow-beijing-rejoice-europe-voa-radio-free-china-disinformation/) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/18/trump-voa-doge-close-fact-checker/) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/world/asia/china-trump-voice-of-america.html))

5. **The White House dismissed a French politician’s demand to return the Statue of Liberty**. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the U.S. would “absolutely not” give back the statue, adding that France “should be very grateful” for America’s role in World War II. Raphaël Glucksmann, a European Parliament member, claimed the Trump administration had abandoned the statue’s values, saying "We gave it to you as a gift, but apparently, you despise it." The statue, however, is U.S. property, and France has no means to reclaim it. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/17/white-house-statue-of-liberty-france-00233883) / [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/17/trump-statue-of-liberty-us-france/82492828007/) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/18/france-statue-of-liberty-return-white-house) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/18/statue-liberty-france-us-white-house/))
