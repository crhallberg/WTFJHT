1/ **The House Freedom Caucus threatened to oppose a stopgap funding bill, which would avert a government shutdown at the end of September**. After Kevin McCarthy floated the idea of a stopgap bill last week, the ultraconservative House lawmakers are now demanding that any short-term spending bill increase the number of Border Patrol agents, require the Homeland Security Secretary to resume building the border wall, address “the unprecedented weaponization” of the Justice Department and FBI, and end “woke” Defense Department policies. Congress, however, is unlikely to pass all 12 appropriations bills by the Sept. 30 deadline, which would then force a shutdown of many federal government services.

2/ **Trump confirmed that he'll skip the first Republican presidential primary debate on Wednesday and instead sit for an interview with Tucker Carlson, which he's reportedly already recorded**. “The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,” Trump wrote on his personal social network. “I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!” Trump is one of 10 Republican presidential candidates who have met the polling and fundraising criteria to qualify for the debate. Trump, however, has refused sign a loyalty pledge committing to support the eventual GOP nominee, which is required to secure a spot on the debate stage.

3/ **The Justice Department is seeking between 27 and 33 years in federal prison in the cases of four Proud Boys convicted of seditious conspiracy**. Prosecutors are seeking 33 years in federal prison for Enrique Tarrio and Joseph Biggs, 30 years for Zachary Rehl, and 27 years for Ethan Nordean. Dominic Pezzola was acquitted of the seditious conspiracy charge but found guilty of assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers. Prosecutors are seeking 20 years for Pezzola.

4/ **Trump agreed to a $200,000 bond in the Georgia criminal case accusing him of conspiring to overturn his 2020 presidential election results in the state**.Under the terms of the "consent bond order," Trump agreed to "perform no act to intimidate any person known to him or her to be a codefendant or witness in this case or to otherwise obstruct the administration of justice" – including on social media – and explicitly includes “posts on social media or reposts of posts made by another individual on social media.” Two of Trump's co-defendants, John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro, both agreed to a $100,000 bond.

5/ **Trump requested that his criminal trial on charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 election be delayed until April 2026** – nearly a year and a half after the 2024 election in which he is the Republican front-runner. Special counsel Jack Smith office, however, said delaying the criminal election subversion case until 2026 would "deny the public its right to a speedy trial." Smith’s team has proposed a Jan. 2, 2024 trial date.
