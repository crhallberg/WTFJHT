1/ **The Springfield City School District has received 36 shooting and bomb threats since Trump and JD Vance falsely claimed that Haitian immigrants were eating pets**, forcing local schools to move classes online and cancel on-campus events. Despite no verifiable evidence or credible reports support the claims, Vance, nevertheless, defended his baseless comments, saying that ‚Äúthe media has a responsibility to fact-check‚Äù stories ‚Äì not him. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/17/jd-vance-wisconsin-rally-immigrants-media) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/17/wittenberg-springfield-ohio-haitians-00179719) / [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/springfield-ohio-pet-eating-claims-haitian-migrants-04598d48) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/local/columbus/2024/09/18/school-shooting-threat-tip-lines-ohio))

2/ **At least 111 former Republican national security officials endorsed Kamala Harris, calling Trump "unfit to serve again as president."** In a [letter to the public](https://rbmralumni4harris.substack.com/p/over-100-republican-national-security), the Republicans conclude that Trump cannot be trusted ‚Äúto support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic [...] and bear true faith and allegiance to the same. They add that Trump "promoted daily chaos in government, praised our enemies and undermined our allies, politicized the military and disparaged our veterans, prioritized his personal interest above American interests and betrayed our values, democracy and this country‚Äôs founding documents.‚Äù Together, they condemned Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúdangerous qualities,‚Äù including his ‚Äúunusual affinity‚Äù for dictators like Putin and ‚Äúcontempt for the norms of decent, ethical and lawful behavior.‚Äù ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/politics/republican-officials-harris-endorsement.html))

3/ **The Georgia Election Integrity Coalition ‚Äì a group of officials and election deniers ‚Äì is reportedly planning to call the results of November‚Äôs election into question before a single vote is cast**. Emails obtained as a result of a public records request sent to David Hancock, an election denier and member of the Gwinnett county board of elections, reveal the behind-the-scenes effort to enact denier-based policies and portray the coming election as beset with fraud. Separately, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger sent a letter to the State Election Board, criticizing ‚Äúthe absurdity of the board‚Äôs actions‚Äù to vote on more than a dozen new election rules and procedures so late in the process. The proposed package of election rules require that a polling place‚Äôs manager and two witnesses hand-count the paper ballots in every ballot box, hand counting of absentee ballots, requiring the public posting of all registered voters, and expanding access for poll watchers. Last month, the board [approved](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2024/08/21/day-1310/#2-the-georgia-state-election-board-a) a new rule requiring a ‚Äúreasonable inquiry‚Äù before certifying state elections. The measure allows local officials to refuse or delay certification of a county‚Äôs election results. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/18/trump-election-georgia) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/elections/georgia-elections-board-rules.html) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/nx-s1-5103887/georgia-election-board-rule-changes) / [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-federalist-right-wing-election-deniers-2024-1235099659/))

4/ **The FBI is investigating suspicious packages containing ‚Äúan unknown substance‚Äù sent to elections officials in more than 16 states**. None of the mail has been deemed hazardous ‚Äì and in one case, the substance was flour ‚Äì but the scare forced evacuations in some locations. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/suspicious-mail-white-powder-election-offices-16-states/story?id=113790813) / [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/elections-workers-security-suspicious-packages-e3400b1e86bc02f7345d9970ef356bec))

5/ **The Teamsters won‚Äôt endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since 1996** following an internal, electronic poll found that 59.6% of members supported a Trump endorsement, while 34% supported a Harris endorsement. The union endorsed Biden in 2020, who became the first sitting president in history to walk a picket line, in addition to [awarding](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/us/politics/biden-union-pensions.html) $36 billion in federal funds to save the pensions of more than 350,000 Teamster truck drivers ‚Äì the¬†largest rescue package for a pension plan in U.S. history. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/us/politics/teamsters-endorsement-2024-election.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/18/teamsters-no-endorsement-2024-election-00179900) / [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/g-s1-23251/teamsters-no-endorsement-2024-trump-harris) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/18/teamsters-endorsement-election/) / [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/teamsters-opt-endorse-presidential-candidate/story?id=113819004) / [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/teamsters-endorsement-harris-trump-2024) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/18/teamsters-no-endorsement-harris-trump-presidential-election.html))

6/ **The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point and projected two more cuts before the end of the year**. It‚Äôs the first rate cut in four years, and brings the Fed‚Äôs benchmark rate to a range between 4.75%-5% from between 5.25 and 5.5%. The Fed said the decision reflected ‚Äúgreater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%‚Äù and that the central bank ‚Äújudges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.‚Äù ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/fed-cuts-rates-by-half-percentage-point-03566d82) / [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-09-18/fomc-rate-decision-and-fed-chair-news-conference) / [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/18/fed-cuts-rates-september-2024-.html) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/18/fed-rate-cut-announcement-00179873) / [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/business/fed-interest-rates) / [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/18/fed-meeting-interest-rate-cut-decision-live-fomc/) / [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/interest-rate-cut-federal-reserve-decision-how-much-rcna171453))

7/ **The U.S. will face a shortage of six million workers by 2032** due, in part, to mismatches between workers and jobs, and the decline in workforce participation among men. According to the study, without increased immigration, working-age people will start to disappear from the labor force, leaving the U.S. unable to sustain its workforce with U.S.-born workers. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-18/us-faces-a-deficit-of-6-million-workers-in-less-than-a-decade))
