1/ **Vice President Kamala Harris used her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention to present a "new way forward" for America, while casting Trump as an “unserious man.”** But, she warned, "the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious." For nearly 40-minute, Harris prosecuted the case against Trump and how “with this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past. A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.” The goal of Trump and Project 2025 is to “pull our country back to the past," she warned. "But America, we are not going back." Harris wove her campaign for president into her personal story as a prosecutor, who began cases with the five words “Kamala Harris, for the people,” pledging “to be a president for all Americans” and "to put country above party and self, to hold sacred America's fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power." Harris also made her strongest remarks so far on where she stands on the Israel-Hamas war and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. "Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself." But, she added, “At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives, lost; desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.” Harris also pledged to continue to work "to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.” While Harris delivered her acceptance speech, Trump [provided live commentary](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/23/trump-respond-harris-dnc-speech) on his personal social media network, sharing his perspectives such as: "Too many 'Thank yous'"; "a lot of talk about childhood"; "LYING AGAIN ABOUT PROJECT 2025"; "IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?"; and for no apparent reason: "Walz was an ASSISTANT Coach, not a COACH." Harris is the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to accept a major party’s nomination. If elected, she would be the first female president in American history.
