*What we know about the Trump rally shooting so far:*

**The shooting at Trump‚Äôs rally in Butler, Pennsylvania is being investigated as an attempted assassination**. Trump said he was shot and hit by a bullet in the ‚Äúupper part of my right ear." His campaign said he‚Äôs ‚Äúfine.‚Äù He added: "I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin." As he was ushered away, Trump raised a fist to the crowd, mouthing: ‚ÄúFight. Fight. Fight.‚Äù The Secret Service said the shooter, described as a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, fired "multiple shots" from an ‚Äúelevated position‚Äù outside of the rally. The gunman and at least one audience member are dead, and two other attendees are critically injured. Biden condemned the attack, saying ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no place in America for this kind of violence. It‚Äôs sick \[...\] We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this." The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the shooting, said it‚Äôs working to identify the gunman and determine the motive. Authorities said they recovered an AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle at the scene. House Republicans also [said](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/14/trump-rally-shooting-oversight-comer-secret-service) they will "conduct a full investigation" into the shooting. Trump‚Äôs campaign said he still plans to attend the Republican National Convention, which is scheduled to begin in Milwaukee on Monday. There have been [327 mass shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_in_2024#List) in the U.S. in 2024 so far.
