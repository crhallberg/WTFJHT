  <p><strong>ðŸ‘‹ Away Message</strong>: Man what day even is it? This past week has been brutal â€“ both for the country and for me personally. I caught a nasty illness that knocked me out completely, forcing me into bed for an entire week. Never been this sick before. I managed to muster the energy for one update, but I cringe knowing it was the only one in the last 11 days. (Don't worry, I'll be back this afternoon with an update!)</p>
  <p>On one hand, I feel like I let WTFJHT readers down â€“ I failed to fulfill my promise to tell you wtf just happened today. And on the other, itâ€™s a reminder of how fragile this whole operation is. No matter how much resilience I try to build into this newsletter, at the end of the day, Iâ€™m still the single point of failure. I donâ€™t have a solution yet, but I do know I need to figure out how to make this newsletter less dependent on me alone. If you have thoughts on how to do that in a scalable and financially viable way, let me know. For now, Iâ€™m just grateful to be back. Thanks for sticking with me. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here.</p>
